## Newton's law of cooling and similar linear laws

In the following, we will follow some historical developments of physical box models, which often depend on certain assumed linear relationships. It can be very confusing if you want a derivation, via first-principles, of these relationships since often none will exist. This is an important-enough point to explain by analogy. 

Consider an object of temperature $T$ placed in a room with ambient temperature $T_a$. A well-known empirical law for the time-evolution of temperature is given by Newton's Law of Cooling, i.e. 
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} = -c(T - T_a).
$$ {#eq-:NLC}
The constant $c > 0$ here has units of $s^{-1}$. 

However, it is important to understand that the above law is often strictly used without derivation and without justification. It can be interpreted as a one-term Taylor expansion of the heat flux when $T - T_a$ is small but very rarely do people use the expansion under this assumption. There is more discussion of the law and its issues in the work by [@besson2012history] and also in [this online discussion](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/56553/are-newtons-law-of-cooling-and-stefans-law-related).

I personally think a better way to think of such laws is that they are assumptions that the rate-of-changes are driven by linear gradients.
