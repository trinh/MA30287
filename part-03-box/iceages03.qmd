# Ice ages III: analysis of the van der Pol equation {#sec-ice3}

In the previous chapter we introduced a canonical model for fast-slow dynamics given by the following system for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon \dot{x} &= y - S(x), \\
\dot{y} &= -x.
\end{aligned}
$$ 

where $\epsilon > 0$ and $\epsilon \to 0$. This led to our study of then numerical computation of solutions and example graphics like this:

We now show how to perform the asymptotic analysis of the above system. The techniques used relate to the analysis of boundary layers studied in @sec-asymptotics03.


## Analysis of the slow manifold

Let 
$$
x(t) = x_0(t) + \epsilon x_1(t) + \epsilon^2 x_2(t) + \ldots, \qquad y(t) = y_0(t) + \epsilon y_1(t) + \epsilon^2 y_2(t) + \ldots 
$$ 
At leading order, we get the following system of equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
0 &= y_0 - S(x), \\
\dot{y_0} &= -x_0.
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-sloweqns} 

First, examine the differential equation on the second line. Since the rate-of-change of $y$ is equal to $-x$, we can analyse the motion in the phase plane by the following cases:
$$
y_0 \text{ is } 
\begin{cases}
\text{decreasing} & \text{for $x_0 > 0$} \\
\text{increasing} & \text{for $x_0 < 0$}
\end{cases}.
$$ 
Therefore, we conclude that the $y$ axis is nullcline in this leading-order approximation. The remaining equation restricts the solution to lie along the **slow manifold**, 
$$
y_0 = S(x) = \frac{1}{3}x_0^3 - x_0. 
$$

According to our analysis, we should have both $y \sim S(x)$ as $\epsilon \to 0$ and also $y$ increasing on $x < 0$ while decreasing on $x > 0$. But this yields an apparent contradiction as $x\to \pm 1$ and $y \to \mp 2/3$. 

The issue is that, at the critical point(s) where $x \to \pm 1$, say $t = t^*$, the solution encounters a shock or boundary layer where the gradient $\dot{x}$ is no longer small. Thus our prior assumption where we neglected $\epsilon \dot{x}$ is invalid. 

## Fast analysis 

Near a shock, we re-scale 
$$
T = \frac{t - t^*}{\epsilon^\alpha} \Longrightarrow t = t^* + \epsilon^\alpha T,
$$
and set $x(t) = X(T)$ and $y(t) = Y(T)$ under this new coordinate change. Essentially, this re-scales the coordinate axes, originally in $t$, near the unknown location of the shock, $t = t^*$. We can verify that the correct balance for re-scaling is chosen with $\alpha = 1$. From the chain rule, we convert derivatives as follows:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}T} = \frac{1}{\epsilon} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}T}.
$$ 
Then the system becomes 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}X}{\mathrm{d}T} &= Y - S(X) \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}Y}{\mathrm{d}T} &= -\epsilon X.
\end{aligned}
$$

We expand now in the typical fashion, setting 
$$
\begin{aligned}
X &= X_0(T) + \epsilon X_1(T) + \ldots \\
Y &= Y_0(T) + \epsilon Y_1(T) + \ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

At leading order, this now yields
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}X_0}{\mathrm{d}T} &= Y_0 - S(X_0) \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}Y_0}{\mathrm{d}T} &= 0. 
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, from the second equation, we obtain 
$$
Y_0 = \text{constant}
$$ 
which is to be expected from the phase-plane diagrams we have shown. Since we have established that the max/min of the slow manifold, $S(X)$, is given by $\pm 2/3$, then we know that the above constant is this value *if the solution had begun from the slow manifold* (see comment later about the initial condition).

Next, the equation for $X_0$ has the form of a first-order nonlinear differential equation that can be studied by phase-line analysis. If the constant $Y_0$ is indeed $\pm 2/3$, then the differential equation for the other component takes the form 
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}X_0}{\mathrm{d}T} = Y_0 - S(X_0) = \pm \frac{2}{3} - S(X_0).
$$ 

This leads to the following picture. 

![Fast dynamics](img/2023-04-12-13-34-21.png){#fig-fastasym}

To begin, we consider the evolution from the points marked 'A' and 'B'. This occurs along the slow manifold. At the point 'B', time reaches the critical point, $t \to t^*$, and the solutions enter the fast dynamics, following along points 'B' to 'C'. Notice that along this segment in the phase plane, 
$$
\frac{2}{3} - S(X_0) > 0, 
$$ 
therefore $X_0$ must increase during this time. However, upon approaching the point 'C', the above LHS tends to zero, and hence $X_0$ slows its increase. This exists the fast dynamics layer and again the solution continues along the slow manifold from 'C' to 'D'. Upon reaching 'D', it again enters a stage of fast dynamics (the $t^*$ point here is a new one). 

## Initial conditions

You will notice that above, we have not really discussed the effect of the initial conditions, say, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
x(0) &= A, \\ 
y(0) &= B. 
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Perhaps more specifically, we have performed our asymptotic analysis with the assumption that the solution starts directly on the slow manifold, i.e. $y \sim S(x)$. Returning to the slow analysis leading to @eq-sloweqns notice that the above conditions will not in general be compatible with the equations (since 'A' and 'B' might be chosen completely different from those values where $y = S(x)$). The conclusion is then that the slow analysis applied cannot be valid near the initial condition.

This turns out to be very similar to the example studied in @sec-asymptotics03, which also had a time-dependent problem where the initial condition was incompatible.

Therefore near $t = 0$, we must introduce an analogous boundary layer. This analysis will be identical to the above fast-scale dynamics except that $t^* = 0$. The conclusion is that if we begin off the manifold $y = S(x)$, the solution will rapidly tend left or right in the phase plane (at near-constant values of $y$). Once it intersects with the manifold, the trajectories then resume the slow and fast dynamics observed above. 

This is now shown below for the initial condition of $x(0) = 2.5$, $y(0) = -1.5$ and $\epsilon = 0.05$.

Notice the red circle in the left phase plot showing the initial condition. We see that the solutions then exhibit the fast dynamics, with $x$ decreasing, until encountering the slow manifold. Thereafter it follows the standard slow-fast dynamics.

On the right image, notice the significant shock or boundary layer near $t = 0$. If desired, we could confirm the size of this boundary-layer regions scales with $\epsilon$.
