<!-- ## Units -->

<!-- It is good to clarify notation and analysis of scientific units. In this course, we will sometimes use square brackets to indicate the units of a quantity. For example, in the next chapter, we will discuss radiation from the sun, measured by $Q = 1380$ W m^{-2}. A Watt (W) is energy per unit time, or joules per second (J/s). So alternatively, we could write $Q = 1380 J/(m^2 s)$, or --> 
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- [Q] = J m^{-2} s^{-1}. -->
<!-- $$ --> 
<!-- This is an example of a **flux**---the flow (W, J/s) per unit area (m^2) of some quantity (in this case, energy). If you are ever confused about what a unit means, it is a good idea to break it into its constituent parts. -->
