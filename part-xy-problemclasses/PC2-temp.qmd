Consider the Navier-Stokes equations (which is a set of equations that dictates fluid flow):
$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}+\left( \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \right)\boldsymbol{u}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p+\nu \nabla^2 \boldsymbol{u}$$
where:

* $\boldsymbol{x}=(x, y, z)^{\mathrm{T}}$ is the direction field (each with dimensions $m$)
* $\boldsymbol{u}=(u, v, w)^{\mathrm{T}}$ is the velocity field where $u$ is the movement along the $x$-direction, $v$ is the movement along the $y$-direction and $w$ is the movement along the $z$-direction (each with dimensions $m \, s^{-1}$)
* $t$ is time (dimension s)
* $\rho$ is the fluid density (dimension $kg \, m^{-3}$)
* $\nu$ is the dynamic viscosity, which represents the resistance to flow due to gravity (with dimensions $m^2 \, s^{-1}$)
* $p$ is the internal pressure of the fluid (with dimension $kg \, m^{-1} \, s^{-2}$)
* $\nabla=\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right)^{\mathrm{T}}$ is the gradient operator (each with the with effective dimension $m^{-1}$).
* $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ is the partial time derivative (with effective dimension $s^{-1}$)
* $\nabla^2=\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}$ is the Laplacaian operator (with effective dimension $m^{-2}$).

Consider the following arbitrary non-dimensionalisation:
$$\boldsymbol{x}=L\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}, \quad \boldsymbol{u}=U\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}, \quad t=T\tilde{t}, \quad p=P\tilde{p}$$
where $[\tilde{x}]=[\tilde{u}]=[\tilde{t}]=[\tilde{p}]=1$ are the new non-dimensional quantities whereas $[L]=m, [U]=m \, s^{-1}, [T]=s$ and $[P]=kg \, m^{-3}$.

Replacing these into the Navier-Stokes equation gives
$$\frac{U}{T}\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\tilde{u}}}{\partial \tilde{t}}+\frac{U^2}{L}\left( \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}} \cdot \tilde{\nabla} \right)\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}=-\frac{P}{L\rho}\tilde{\nabla} \tilde{p}+\frac{\nu U}{L^2} \tilde{\nabla}^2 \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}$$
where $\tilde{\nabla}$ is the gradient operator in the new coordinate space $(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{z})$.  The tildas will be dropped henceforth.  Rearranging to make the coefficient of the time derivative 1 gives
$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}+\frac{UT}{L}\left( \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \right)\boldsymbol{u}=-\frac{PT}{U L \rho}\nabla p+\frac{\nu T}{L^2} \nabla^2 \boldsymbol{u}.$$

The most convenient term to eliminate is the coefficient of the pressure.  Therefore, suppose the choice of the non-dimensionalisation parameters needs to be chosen such that
$$\frac{PT}{\rho L U}=1.$$
This means that the term $P$ can be written as
$$P=\frac{\rho U L}{T}.$$

> Checking the dimensions:
$$[P]=\left[ \frac{\rho U L }{T} \right]=[\rho][U][L][T]^{-1}=kg \, m^{-3} \, m \, s^{-1} \, m \, s^{-1}=kg \, m^{-1} \, s^{-2}$$
which is indeed the dimension for pressure.

### Reynolds Number

Suppose that the term $\frac{U T}{L}$ should also be equal to 1, then this would mean that the time non-dimensionalisation can be done by having $T=\frac{L}{U}$.

> Checking the dimensions:
$$[T]=\left[ \frac{L}{U} \right]=[L][U]^{-1}=m \, m^{-1} \, s=s$$
which is indeed the dimension for time.

Therefore, with these choices of $T$ and $P$, the Navier-Stokes equation becomes
$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}+\left( \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \right)\boldsymbol{u}=-\nabla p+\frac{\nu}{U L} \nabla^2 \boldsymbol{u}.$$

The term $\frac{L U}{\nu}$ is known as the Reynolds number, denoted $Re$ which is a non-dimensional quantity.

> Check the dimension of the Reynolds number:
$$[Re]=\left[ \frac{L U}{\nu} \right]=[L][U][\nu]^{-1}=m \, m \, s^{-1} \, m^2 \, s=1$$
meaning that the Reynolds number is dimensionless.

Therefore, this gives the non-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation for fluid flow
$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}+\left( \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \right)\boldsymbol{u}=-\nabla p+\frac{1}{Re} \nabla^2 \boldsymbol{u}.$$

The Reynolds number $Re$ gives a measure for the effect of viscosity for fluid flow or for the movement through a fluid.  As $Re$ gets larger, the fluid becomes less viscous hence reducing the effect of viscosity on the movement and the inertial forces dominate. (The case when $Re \to \infty$ is called inviscid flow where there is no viscosity.)  As $Re$ decreases, the viscosity increases, making the movement depend on the viscous forces more than the inertial forces.

The Reynolds number is important in modelling since when length and speed scales change from full-sized objects to smaller models (like models of cars and buildings for testing purposes), the same environment cannot be translated from one to the other (since a full sized building in 20mph winds will not move whereas 20mph winds on a small scale of model of the building will be affected much more).  However, if the Reynolds number is fixed in both cases, the model can be made more realistic.

### Strouhal Number

Suppose that the time is non-dimensionalised differently as $T=\frac{1}{f}$ where $f$ is a frequency.  Then the Navier-Stokes equation becomes
$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}+\frac{U}{Lf}\left( \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \right)\boldsymbol{u}=-\nabla p+\frac{\nu}{f L^2} \nabla^2 \boldsymbol{u}.$$

The term $\frac{f L^2}{\nu}$, just as before, is equivalent to the Reynolds number as before which is dimensionless.

> Indeed
$$[Re]=\left[ \frac{f L^2}{\nu} \right]=[f][L]^2[\nu]^{-1}=s^{-1} \, m^2 \, m^{-2} \, s=1.$$

The other term, $\frac{Lf}{U}$ is known as the Strouhal number (denoted $St$ which should not be confused with the Stokes number of the Stanton number).  Therefore the Navier-Stokes equations can now be written as
$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{St}\left( \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla \right)\boldsymbol{u}=-\nabla p+\frac{1}{Re} \nabla^2 \boldsymbol{u}.$$

The Strouhal number represents the effect of vortex shedding in flow across an object.  The higher $St$ is, the more vortices will be generated by the flow.

This is an example where the same problem can be non-dimensionalised in two different ways to yield equations with different applications.
