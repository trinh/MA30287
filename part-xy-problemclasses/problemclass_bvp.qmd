# Problem class 3: BVPs {#sec-pclass-bvp}

This problem class will involve the completion of the ODE studied in asymptotic approximations III. We will then study the boundary-value problem which forms part of the third problem set, namely: 
$$
\begin{gathered}
\epsilon T'' + 2T' + T = 0, \\
T(0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad T(1) = 1.
\end{gathered}
$$
The associated Python note is in `lectures/lecture12-SolvingBVPs`. You will gain an appreciation for some of the unique elements that are introduced when looking at $\epsilon \to 0$ in boundary-value problems.
