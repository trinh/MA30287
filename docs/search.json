As mathematicians, we also have a unique perspective, and applied mathematics plays important roles in many of the above categories.\nIn essence, this course will include topics and themes are united by aspects of mathematical modelling and mathematical analysis and this is what distinguishes our style of study from adjacent areas of science and social science.\nWe will study so-called conceptual or box models of the climate. This involves some of the blue elements of the above figure, and thus we use coarse-grained models of describing the climate. This will involve applying some of the dynamical systems (phase-plane analysis of ODEs) you have learned previously, along with new methods of computation and analysis. The source for this part of the course will be (Kaper and Engler 2013).\nA secondary part of this course will involve more in-depth analysis of the physical models that govern the blue elements of the above figure. This moves us from the toy box models studied above to digging into the underlying physics—this also falls into the category of Mathematical Geoscience. For example, we will use partial differential equations to study the atmosphere and develop a deeper understanding of greenhouse gases.

    "text": "1.1 Derivation of the 1D heat equation\nIn order to demonstrate some of the basic principles of this course, let us demonstrate the derivation of the heat equation. We are interested in modelling the heat in a volume, \\(V\\), which, for the sake of concreteness is given by a long cylinder with its axis along \\(x \\in [0, L]\\). We assume that the side walls of the cylinder are insulated and the temperature only varies along the \\(x\\) direction.\nAt any point along this rod, the internal heat is given by \\(\\rho c T(x, t)\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the material (kg/m3), \\(c\\) is the specific heat capacity (J/(kg K)), and \\(T\\) is the temperature (K). Therefore, the heat energy along any segment in the rod is calculated from\nIf the heat changes, then the rate of change of heat energy is given the time derivative of the above quantity. By conservation of energy, any change of the internal energy must be equal to the inflow or outflow of heat at the ends, \\(x = a\\) or \\(x = b\\). We therefore write \\(q\\) for the flux (or flow) of heat.\nWe need a constitutive law that dictates how energy is exchanged at the boundaries. Based on intuition, it is sensible to assume that the flow of heat proceeds from hot to cold. For example, hot air rises towards cool air; or heat from a hot mug of tea flows and diffuses outwards into a cold room. Therefore, we write this as\nThis is known as Fourier’s law. The quantity \\(k\\) is the thermal conductivity, and its units are W/(m K). Because a Watt is a Joule/s, you can also see that the units of \\(k\\) are J/(m K s). The quantity \\(q\\) is the flux, and you can verify that it is given in units of J/(m2 s).\nTherefore by energy conservation, we have \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}  \\int_a^b \\rho c T \\, \\mathrm{d}x = {\\color{blue}q(x = a, t) - q(x = b, t)},\n\\] i.e. the change in internal heat is equal to the flow through the ends. Note that we have added-in the heat flux due to \\(x = a\\) assuming positive \\(q\\) refers to heat moving from left-to-right. Conversely, we subtract it away from \\(x = b\\). We can alternatively write this as \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}  \\int_a^b \\rho c T \\, \\mathrm{d}x = {\\color{blue} -\\int_a^b \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} \\, \\mathrm{d}x}.\n\\]\nSubstitution Fourier’s law, we can then write \\[\n\\int_a^b \\rho c \\frac{{\\partial}T}{{\\partial}t} \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_a^b k \\frac{{\\partial}^2 T}{{\\partial}x^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\] Because the above integral identity needs to be true for all possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then it must be true everywhere (this is sometimes referred to as the du Bois-Reymond lemma or the bump lemma. Therefore we are left with the classic heat equation.\nIn order to produce a sensible physical solution, partial differential equations are typically supplemented by initial conditions and boundary conditions. The initial condition prescribes the state of the function at some initial time, typically \\(t = 0\\). Boundary conditions prescribe how the function behaves on the boundary of its domain, which in this case is \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = L\\). An example might be\nwhich expresses, respectively, that the temperature starts from a constant temperature, \\(T_0\\), and where the ends of the rod are kept at temperature \\(T_a\\) and \\(T_b\\).",

    "text": "1.2 Deriving the 1D transport (continuity) equation\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 note\n\n\n\nThis was a new addition in 2024.\n\n\nConsider the mass transport of some substance with density \\(\\rho(x, t)\\), immersed in a fluid, along a one-dimensional line in \\(x\\). If desired, you may consider the substance as existing in three-dimensional space, and propagating along the \\(x\\)-direction, with its behaviour independent of \\(y\\) and \\(z\\). Initially, when considered at time \\(t\\), the mass of the substance between two points, \\(a\\), and \\(b\\), is:\n\\[\nm_\\text{blob}(t) = \\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \\rho (x, t) \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\nAs time increases the particles of the substance will move due to the fluid moving; at the same time, the fluid volume which is initially contained in \\(x\\in [a(0), b(0)]\\) will also move. We want to find how the mass of the blob changes in time, and hence consider the quantity \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_\\text{blob}}{\\mathrm{d}t}  = \\int_a^b \\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} \\, \\mathrm{d}x + \\rho(b, t) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}b}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\rho(a, t) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}a}{\\mathrm{d}t}.\n\\]\nThe above considers the intrinsic rate of change of the function within the integrand, but then adds the extra mass due to the right boundary shifting rightwards (\\(b\\)) and subtracts the mass due to the left boundary shifting rightwards (\\(a\\)). It is known as the Leibniz integral rule. We can thus write this within the integral as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_\\text{blob}}{\\mathrm{d}t}  = \\int_a^b \\left[ \\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x} \\left(\\rho(x, t) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right) \\right] \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\nHowever, the quantity \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\equiv u(x, t)\n\\]\nrepresents the velocity of the fluid (which for the moment we assume to be a known and provided quantity). Therefore we can write the mass change as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_\\text{blob}}{\\mathrm{d}t}  = \\int_a^b \\left[ \\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x} \\left(\\rho u\\right) \\right] \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\nThis result, which explains how to pass a derivative through an integral express mass of a substance within a flow is known as the Reynolds Transport Theorem. We have just derived it in 1D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReynolds Transport Theorem\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\rho = \\rho(x, t)\\) be some quantity (such as density) that is advected along a one-dimensional line in \\(x\\) due to a fluid with velocity \\(u(x, t)\\). Then \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \\left[ \\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x}(\\rho u)\\right] \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\n\n\nWe may now consider the substance being transported along the \\(x\\)-direction. If there is no interior creation or destruction of the source, then by conservation of mass, it must be the case that \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_\\text{blob}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0.\n\\]\nThus, again since the above integral identity applies to all possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it must be the case that the integrand is zero. Thus we conclude with the so-called tranport equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-dimensional transport equation\n\n\n\nThe transport of a substance described by \\(\\rho(x, t)\\) advected along a one-dimensional line in \\(x\\) due to a fluid with velocity \\(u(x, t)\\) is given by \\[\n\\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x}(\\rho u) = 0.\n\\]\n\n\nAgain, we must consider the above problem in combination with potential initial conditions and boundary conditions. For instance, we might specify that the substance begins from some initial state, say \\[\n\\rho(x, 0) = \\rho_0(x).\n\\]\nThe boundary conditions are more subtle. It is not always obvious what the boundary conditions should be on a problem.\nHere is an example of a solution of such a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear advection equation with constant speed\n\n\n\nSolve the problem given by \\[\n\\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + c\\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}x} = 0,\n\\] where the velocity \\(u = c\\) is constant. You may assume the initial condition is given by \\[\n\\rho(x, 0) = \\rho_0(x) = e^{-x^2}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nThe general solution is given by \\[\n\\rho(x, t) = F(x - ct),\n\\] where \\(F\\) is an arbitrary (differentiable) function. You can verify this via the chain rule, noting that \\[\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t} = -c F'(x - ct) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = F'(x - ct).\n\\] Applying the initial condition at \\(t = 0\\) gives \\(F(x) = \\rho_0(x)\\) and thus \\[\n\\rho(x, t) = e^{-(x - ct)^2}.\n\\]\nYou may plot this to discover that it is, as perhaps expected, a Gaussian profile moving to the right at constant speed (for \\(c &gt; 0\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFowler, Andrew. 2011.

To apply this principle, let us non-dimensionalise the equation Equation 1.1. Let us consider the heat equation as given by the system \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} &= \\kappa \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\\\\nT(x, 0) &= T_\\text{init} \\\\\nT(0, t) &= T_a \\\\\nT(L, t) &= T_b.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that the constant \\(\\kappa\\) is known as the thermal diffusivity, and is given by \\[\n\\kappa = \\frac{k}{\\rho c},\n\\] which were the units previously introduced.\nWe introduce typical scales for each of the variables. For example, we non-dimensionalise the temperature, distance, and time by setting \\[\nT = [T] T', \\qquad x = [x] x', \\qquad t = [t] t'.\n\\] Remember that via the chain rule, we have that \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x'}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x'} = \\frac{1}{[x]} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x'}.\n\\]\nSubstitution into the equation now yields \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial T'}{\\partial t'} &= \\frac{\\kappa[t]}{[x]^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\\\\nT'(x', 0) &= T_\\text{init} \\\\\nT'(0, t') &= \\frac{T_a}{[T]} \\\\\nT'(L/[x], t') &= \\frac{T_b}{[T]}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBe sure to work out the above for yourself. For example, notice that the previous boundary at \\(x = L\\) is now sent to \\(x' = L/[x]\\). Now we see that the final equation is beautifully simple: At this point, we can identify a crucial non-dimensional parameter given by \\[\n\\Pi = \\frac{\\kappa [t]}{[x]^2} = \\frac{k [t]}{\\rho c [x]^2}.\n\\]\nAlthough this looks quite complicated, you can test that this parameter is indeed non-dimensional by looking up the units for thermal conductivity, \\(k\\), density \\(\\rho\\), and specific heat \\(c\\), and verifying that indeed \\(\\Pi\\) is non-dimensional.",

    "text": "2.4 Choice of units\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nIt is important to remember that there are technically no wrong choices for the scales [x], [T], and [t], as long as they yield consistent balances. However, some choices are better than others for the context of the problem. Let us select: \\[\n[x] = L \\qquad [T] = T_\\text{init}.\n\\]\nThis means our unit of length is “one pipe” (if this is indeed a pipe), and our unit of temperature is whatever the initial temperature was set to be. The choice of time is free at the moment, and therefore we can select time as \\[\n\\Pi = \\frac{\\kappa [t]}{[x]^2} = 1 \\Longrightarrow [t] = \\frac{L^2}{k}.\n\\]\nNow we see that the final equation is beautifully simple: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial T'}{\\partial t'} &= \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\\\\nT'(x', 0) &= 1 \\\\\nT'(0, t') &= \\frac{T_a}{T_\\text{init}} \\equiv A, \\\\\nT'(1, t') &= \\frac{T_b}{T_\\text{init}} \\equiv B.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\n\n2.4.1 Interpretation\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nWhat is the whole point of the above exercise?\nIn the original problem, there were five parameters: \\[\n\\kappa, \\qquad T_\\text{init}, \\qquad T_a, \\qquad T_b, \\qquad L.\n\\]\nImagine a situation where you are performing an analysis of heat spread in different pipes of different materials (characterised by \\(\\kappa\\)) and lengths (\\(L\\)), with different initial and boundary temperatures. That is potentially a highly complicated parameter space to search (five-dimensional).\nRather than solving the problem again and again for each change in parameters, what the analysis yielding (Equation 2.1) reveals is that the parameter space only needs to be two-dimensional, for parameters \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Therefore, by solving the problem at many different values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the solution space can be completely mapped.\nHere is an example. Consider heat diffusion through common brick, which possesses a thermal diffusivity of \\[\n\\kappa = 5.2 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}.\n\\] Therefore a brick that is about L = 10cm = 0.1m in size has a typical timescale of \\[\n[t] = \\frac{L^2}{\\kappa} \\approx 1.9 \\times 10^4 \\mathrm{s} \\approx 5 \\mathrm{hrs}.\n\\]\nThe above choice of [t] is representative of the typical timescale you can expect for heat to diffuse through the brick. As you can see it’s very long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, we have gone from a system where we needed to consider five parameters to a system where we only need to specify two (essentially, the ratio of the initial heat to the boundary values). This is an enormous simplification.\nMoreover, your analysis has further identified the key non-dimensional parameters that appear, including: \\[\n\\Pi = \\frac{\\kappa [t]}{[x]^2}, \\qquad A = \\frac{T_a}{T_\\mathrm{init}}, \\qquad B = \\frac{T_b}{T_\\text{init}}, \\qquad \\frac{L}{[x]}\n\\]\nIn this particular problem, you had the freedom to choose \\(L\\) to remove one parameter (the ratio of lengths), and time could be chosen to set \\(\\Pi = 1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFowler, Andrew. 2011.

Setting \\(\\mathrm{d}T/\\mathrm{d}t\\) to zero, we see that there is a unique steady-state given by \\[\nT = \\left(\\frac{Q(1-a)}{4\\sigma\\gamma}\\right)^{1/4}.\n\\]\nIf we take \\(Q \\approx 1370 \\,\\mathrm{W m}^{-2}\\), \\(a \\approx 0.3\\), \\(\\sigma \\approx 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{W} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\mathrm{K}^{-4}\\), we then get \\[\nT \\approx 255 \\mathrm{K} = -18^\\circ \\mathrm{C}.\n\\] under the assumption that \\(\\gamma = 1\\).

There is an additional multiplication by \\((1 - a)\\) where \\(a\\) is the planetary albedo, which characterises amount of energy reflected due to the surface properties. Light surfaces like snow will have high albedo, \\(a \\approx 0.9\\), while darker surfaces like the ocean have smaller albedo, \\(a \\approx 0.3\\). The global average albedo is \\(a \\approx 0.3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy from the Earth\n\n\n\nWe now wish to characterise the energy, \\(E_{out}\\), and in the case of Earth, this will correspond to longwave radiation (infra-red) emitted into space. All bodies characterised by a temperature, say \\(T_e\\), will emit radiation, \\(Q_e\\). As a model, we can consider \\(Q_e\\) to be given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that \\[\nQ_e = \\sigma T_e^4,\n\\tag{3.3}\\] where \\(\\sigma \\approx 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} W m^{-2} K^{-4}\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nNow although the Earth’s surface may emit radiation according to (Equation 3.3), some of this radiation will be absorbed by the atmosphere and reflected back. This is the greenhouse effect. As a consequence of the greenhouse gas, the surface temperature of the Earth, \\(T\\), will be larger than the effective emitting temperature, \\(T_e\\). For the moment, we model this as \\[\nT_e = \\gamma^{1/4} T_e,\n\\tag{3.4}\\] where \\(\\gamma &lt; 1\\) is a greenhouse gas factor, which depends on the properties of the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal heat energy\n\n\n\nDue to this incoming energy, the Earth will cool or heat in response. We need to know how the internal temperature of an object responds to an input in energy. The general formula is \\[\n\\text{Internal heat energy} = \\text{volume} \\times (\\rho c_p) \\times T.\n\\] The key quantity is the experimentally determined, \\(c_p\\), which corresponds to the specific heat capacity. It is given in the SI units of \\(\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}\\), i.e. energy per unit mass per unit temperature. Note that this applied to a shell around the planet of thickness \\(d\\) in the atmosphere, and so the mass is given by \\[\n\\text{mass} = (4 \\pi R^2) d \\rho\n\\tag{3.6}\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the average density of the atmosphere. Let us imagine the increase in temperature, \\(\\Delta T\\),during an interval of time, \\(\\Delta t\\). You can now verify that \\[\n\\Bigl[ (4 \\pi R^2) d \\rho \\Bigr] c_p (\\Delta T)\n\\] returns the units of Joules—i.e. this is the internal energy produced during the time \\(\\Delta t\\). We then have \\[\n\\Bigl[ (4 \\pi R^2) d \\rho \\Bigr] c_p \\Delta T =  \\Delta t (E_{in} - E_{out}).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZero-dimensional model for the surface temperature of the Earth\n\n\n\nThe Earth’s temperature, as measured on a layer of thickness \\(d\\) at the troposphere is given by the following ordinary differential equation (ODE) for \\(T = T(t)\\): \\[\nC \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{4} Q(1 - a) - \\sigma \\gamma T^4,\n\\tag{3.7}\\] where we have defined \\[\nC = \\rho c_p d\n\\] as the heat capacity of the atmosphere. Above, the solar flux, Q is often taken to be \\(Q = 1370\\) W/m2, \\(\\sigma = 5.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\) W/(m2K4), and \\(\\gamma \\leq 1\\) is the greenhouse gas factor.",

For instance:\n\nConsider the effects of a non-constant and nonlinear albedo. Since the albedo depends on the material property (water vs. ice vs. land), we can incorporate a toy model for spatial variability by allowing the albedo to depend on temperature, \\(a = a(T)\\).\nConsider the time-dependence. What happens if the system starts out of the steady state? Does it tend to relax to its equilibrium profile? Can we analyse the temporal properties of the solutions?\nCan we incorporate latitude (or longitudinal) dependence into the model. For instance, should the albedo and solar radiation be considered as functions of the latitude?\nShould we incorporate the effects of diffusion (heat spreading out) or convection (heat transported with flows)?\nTo what extent should we consider the effects of the atmosphere on the absorption and reflection properties of the incoming (and outgoing) energy?\n\nMany of these questions are much more involve, as they require differential or partial differential equations.

As you can see, it is not as useful to specify that \\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\sin{x} = \\lim_{x\\to 0} x.\n\\] In contrast, the asymptotic relation is much more prescriptive about the way that the functions are approaching the limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of \\(\\sim\\), \\(\\gg\\), and \\(\\ll\\)\n\n\n\nFirst, the notation \\[\nf(x) \\ll g(x), \\qquad x \\to x_0,\n\\] is read as “\\(f(x)\\) is much smaller than \\(g(x)\\) as \\(x \\to x_0\\)” and means \\[\n\\lim_{x\\to x_0} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0.  \n\\] We may analogously use \\(g(x) \\gg f(x)\\) for “much greater than”.\nSecond, the notation \\[\nf(x) \\sim g(x), \\qquad x \\to x_0,\n\\] is read as “\\(f(x)\\) is asymptotic to \\(g(x)\\) as \\(x \\to x_0\\)”, and means that the error between \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) tends to zero as \\(x \\to x_0\\), or \\[\n\\lim_{x\\to x_0} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1.  \n\\] We will often say “\\(f\\) is like \\(g\\)” or “\\(f\\) behaves like \\(g\\)”,\n\n\nHere are some examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sin x \\sim x \\sim \\tan x\\) as \\(x \\to 0\\)\n\\(x^2 + x + 1 \\sim \\dfrac{x^3 + \\sin x}{1 + x}\\) as \\(x \\to \\infty\\)\n\\(\\sin x \\ll \\cos x\\) as \\(x \\to 0\\)\n\n\n\nIn the examination of limiting processes, often the main issue of consideration is the relative sizes of quantities defined according to their powers. For example, if \\(x\\) is a very small number, with \\(x = 10^{-5}\\), then \\(x^5\\) is much smaller than \\(x\\) (in terms of our notation, \\(x^5 \\ll x\\) as \\(x \\to 0\\)). On the other hand, we might not care so much about the difference between \\[\nx^5 \\quad \\text{vs.} \\quad 5 x^5\n\\] The point is that the of \\(x^5\\) and \\(5 x^5\\) is the same as \\(x \\to 0\\). The “Big-Oh” notation formalises this distinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of Big-Oh\n\n\n\nWe write \\(f = O(g)\\) as \\(x \\to x_0\\) to mean that there exists constants \\(K &gt; 0\\) and \\(x^* &gt; 0\\) such that \\[\n|f| &lt; K |g| \\quad \\text{for all $|x - x_0| &lt; x^*$}.\n\\]\n\n\nIn practice, the use of the order symbol is very natural and you will not need to work with the technical definition. For example, when you derive the terms of the Maclaurin/Taylor series, you are naturally clustering all the terms of the same order (power) together. For us, the \\(O\\) symbol provides a very convenient way of separating terms of different sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\\(2\\sin x = O(\\tan x)\\) as \\(x \\to 0\\)\n\\(x^2 + x + 1 = O\\left(\\dfrac{5x^3 + \\sin x}{1 + x}\\right)\\) as \\(x \\to \\infty\\)\n\n\n\nLet us return to the case of the quadratic example (Equation 5.1). Using the O notation, we can write \\[\nx =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 - \\epsilon + 2 \\epsilon^2 + O(\\epsilon^3) \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1 + O(\\epsilon^2)\n\\end{cases}\n\\] for the two roots. Alternatively, we can truncate the expansions and simply using the \\(\\sim\\) symbol: \\[\nx \\sim\n\\begin{cases}\n1 - \\epsilon  \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]",

    "text": "6.1 Returning to the projectile problem\nIn Chapter 4 and Chapter 21 you studied the non-dimensionalisation of the projectile problem. Once re-scaled, it takes the following form: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} &= -\\frac{1}{(1 + \\epsilon y)^2}, \\qquad t &gt; 0 \\\\\ny(0) &= 0, \\\\\ny'(0) &= 1.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nThis is a difficult problem without, in fact, any explicit solutions. However, we can estimate the solution in the limit \\(\\epsilon \\to 0\\). We expand the solution as \\[\ny(t) = y_0(t) + \\epsilon y_1(t) + \\epsilon^2 y_2(t) + \\ldots\n\\] In order to expand the denominator, you can use Taylor’s theorem to expand the function \\[\nf(x) = (1 + x)^\\alpha = f(0) + f'(0)x + \\ldots = 1 + \\alpha x + \\ldots\n\\] around \\(x = 0\\).\nThe differential equation now yields \\[\ny_0'' + \\epsilon y_1'' + \\epsilon^2 y_2'' + \\ldots = -\\left[1 - 2\\epsilon \\left(y_0 + \\epsilon y_1 + \\ldots\\right) + \\ldots \\right]\n\\] so grouping terms together order-by-order yields \\[\n\\Bigl[ y_0'' + 1 \\Bigr] + \\epsilon \\Bigl[ y_1'' - 2y_0\\Bigr] + \\ldots = 0.\n\\]\nWe can similarly substitute the expansion into the initial conditions. Altogether, at leading order, we obtain the following system to solve: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_0'' + 1 &= 0, \\\\\ny_0(0) &= 0, \\\\\ny_0'(0) &= 1.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Integrating twice and applying the boundary conditions gives us \\[\ny_0(t) = -\\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t.\n\\] In fact, this is simply the parabolic motion you would expect from school Physics. The \\(\\epsilon = 0\\) solution corresponds to assuming that the mass at the centre of the planet is dominant and then acceleration is constant.\nHowever, we can now proceed to higher order and examine the nonlinear effects. Proceeding to \\(O(\\epsilon)\\), we have the following system to solve: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1'' &= 2y_0, \\\\\ny_1(0) &= 0, \\\\\ny_1'(0) &= 0.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Notice the boundary conditions come from the fact there are no \\(\\epsilon\\) corrections in the original boundary conditions, so \\(y_n(0) = y_n'(0) = 0\\) for all \\(n &gt; 0\\). Again this system is simple to integrate. Integrating the solution for \\(y_0\\) twice and substitution of the initial conditions yields \\[\ny_1(t) = -\\frac{1}{12}t^4 + \\frac{1}{3}t^3.\n\\] We have thus solved for the asymptotic approximation to two orders. We have \\[\ny(t) \\sim \\Bigl[ -\\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t\\Bigr] + \\epsilon \\Bigl[ -\\frac{1}{12}t^4 + \\frac{1}{3}t^3\\Bigr].\n\\] This was quite an accomplishment! We have taken a problem that was not easily solvable in explicit form and through fairly simple integrations, obtained an approximation to two orders in \\(\\epsilon\\). How good is it? Let us solve the problem numerically and compare with the asymptotic approximation.",

    "text": "8.2 A singular first-order ODE problem\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nPreviously in Chapter 3, we derived a basic equation that governs the temperature on the surface of the planet. This equation had the following form: \\[\n(\\rho c_p V) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = E_{\\text{in}}(t, T) - E_{\\text{out}}(t, T).\n\\]\nFor the purpose of this section, let us make up a toy model. We suggest, in non-dimensional form, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\epsilon \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= R(t) - T, \\quad t \\geq 0 \\\\\nT(0) &= T^*,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8.1}\\] where we consider \\(\\epsilon &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\epsilon \\ll 1\\). You can think of the above model as modelling the temperature on a substance that radiates heat in a fashion proportional to itself (\\(-T\\)) and is being subjected to an (incoming) heat source, \\(R\\). Let us take as an example, \\[\nR(t) = 1 + A \\cos(t).\n\\] Our choice for \\(R\\) is not so important.

The region in \\(t\\) where this rapid change occurs is called a boundary layer.\nIf we repeat the experiment with an even smaller value of \\(\\epsilon\\), we would observe that the size of this boundary layer seems to tends to zero as \\(\\epsilon \\to 0\\).

    "text": "8.3 Boundary layer theory\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nWe seek a method that will allow us to develop a uniformly valid approximation, i.e. an approximation that is good everywhere in the relevant domain, \\(t \\geq 0\\). Begin by performing the usual asymptotic approximation: \\[\nT(t) = T_0(t) + \\epsilon T_1(t) + \\epsilon^2 T_2(t) + \\ldots\n\\] Substitution into the ODE (Equation 8.1) yields at leading order, \\[\n0 = R(t) - T_0(t) \\Longrightarrow T_0(t) = R(t) = 1 + A \\cos(t).\n\\] As we have noted, this approximation fails to satisfy the initial condition, \\(T(0) = T^*\\) in general. It is possible to go to higher order but this is not so important at the moment. So for now, we have obtained: \\[\nT_{\\text{outer}} \\sim \\Bigl[ 1 + A\\cos t\\Bigr].\n\\] We have chosen to refer to this as the outer solution for reasons that will be abundantly clear. But rather than satisfying \\(T(0) = T^*\\), this approximation has the limiting behaviour of \\[\n\\lim_{t \\to 0} T_{\\text{outer}} \\sim \\Bigl[ 1 + A\\Bigr]\n\\] Above, we have only included the leading term in the limit expression.\n\n8.3.1 The inner scaling\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nOur intuition follows a very similar logic to the examination of the singular root in Section 5.1.1. Above, our naive assumption was that \\(\\epsilon T'(t)\\) could be ignored since \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small number. However, this may not be the case if the gradient is very large.\nOur intuition further suggests that the boundary layer occurs near \\(t = 0\\) and that it scales in size with \\(\\epsilon\\). Therefore, let us set \\[\nt = \\epsilon^{\\alpha} s,\n\\] as a change of coordinates. We expect \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\) (otherwise \\(t\\) is not small), and within this region, we expect the new coordinate, \\(s\\), to be \\(O(1)\\) (of moderate size). We then transform the unknown function: \\[\nT(t) = T(\\epsilon s) = U(s),\n\\] and seek a new differential equation for \\(U\\). By the chain rule, \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\epsilon^{-\\alpha} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}s}.\n\\] Before substituting into the equation, we are prudent to examine the behaviour of \\(R(t)\\) near \\(t = 0\\). We know by Taylor’s theorem that \\[\nR(t) = 1 + A \\left(1 - \\frac{t^2}{2} + \\ldots \\right).\n\\] Therefore, under the substitution, we may approximate \\(R\\) by its leading terms: \\[\nR( \\epsilon^{\\alpha} s) \\sim 1 + A.\n\\] For now, we will not need more terms than this. Substituting into the ODE now gives \\[\n\\epsilon^{1-\\alpha} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}s} \\sim \\Bigl[1 + A\\Bigr] - U.\n\\] Now in order to involve the first term, it is sensible to select \\[\n1 - \\alpha = 0 \\Longrightarrow \\alpha = 1.\n\\]\n\n\n8.3.2 The inner equation\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nTherefore, the correct coordinate re-scaling was the ‘obvious’ one: \\[\nt = \\epsilon s.\n\\]\nSubstituting this again in (Equation 8.1): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}s} &= 1 + A\\cos(\\epsilon s) - U, \\\\\nU(0) &= T^*.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe procedure is now exactly the same. We expand \\[\nU(s) = U_0(s) + \\epsilon U_1(s) + \\epsilon^2 U_2(s) + \\ldots\n\\] At leading order, we get \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nU_0' &= 1 + A - U_0 \\\\\nU_0(0) &= T^*.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe above ODE can be solved by integrating factors. Multiplying both sides be \\(e^s\\), we have \\[\n(U_0 e^s)' = (1 + A)e^s.\n\\] Integrate and use the initial condition: \\[\nU_0(s) = (1 + A) + (T^* - (1 +A))e^{-s}.\n\\] This is exactly what we expect. Notice that \\[\n\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} U_0(s) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} T_{\\text{outer}}\n\\tag{8.2}\\] therefore the outer limit of our inner solution matches the inner limit of our outer solution. In terms of outer coordinates, our inner solution is approximated as follows: \\[\nT_{\\text{inner}} \\sim (1 + A) + (T^* - (1 +A))e^{-t/\\epsilon}.\n\\]\nLet’s finally plot this with our previous curves:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\nTs = 0\nep = 0.2\nA = 0.1\nf = lambda t, T: 1/ep*(1 + A*np.cos(t) - T)\n\ntmax = 20\nsol = solve_ivp(f, [0, tmax], [Ts], dense_output=True)\n\nt = np.linspace(0, tmax, 1000)\ny = sol.sol(t)\nplt.plot(t, y[0])\nplt.plot(t, 1 + A*np.cos(t), '--')\nplt.plot(t, (1 + A) + (Ts - (1 + A))*np.exp(-t/ep), '--')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt works beautifully!\n\n\n8.3.3 Summary\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nLet us summarise the procedure of matched asymptotics.\n\nExpand the solution of the differential equation naively in the typical asymptotic expansion (e.g. in powers of \\(\\epsilon\\)).\nNotice that the approximation does not satisfy certain boundary conditions.\nRe-scale the coordinates in the ‘inner’ regions.\nDevelop an inner solution that satisfies the boundary condition.

Let \\[\nT(x, t) = G(t) H(x).\n\\] Substitution into the PDE gives \\[\nG'(t) H(x) = \\kappa G(t) H''(x),\n\\] and we attempt to separate the functions of \\(t\\) to one side and the functions of \\(x\\) to the other. \\[\n\\frac{G'(t)}{G'(t)} = \\kappa \\frac{H''(x)}{H(x)}\n\\] Now in order for two completely different functions dependent on two completely different independent variables to be equal in this way, then this implies that both sides must be equal to a constant. So we have \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nG' &= \\lambda G \\\\\nH''  &= \\lambda \\kappa H.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Therefore \\(G = \\mathrm{const} \\times e^{\\lambda t}\\). Because of the boundary conditions that would require \\(T = A e^{i\\omega t}\\), you can check that \\(\\lambda = 0\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) real are both impossible.

You will do this in the problem set, and obtain \\[\nr = \\pm \\sqrt{i} \\sqrt{\\omega/\\kappa} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\omega/\\kappa} \\frac{1 + i}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\] Therefore \\[\nH(x) = C_1 e^{\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}x}e^{\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}ix}+ C_2 e^{-\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}x}e^{-\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}ix}.\n\\] The first solution should be discarded since it blows up as \\(x \\to \\infty\\).\nFinally, we conclude that the solution is given by \\[\nT = e^{i\\omega t} e^{-\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}x}e^{-\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}ix}.\n\\] Move the imaginary arguments together: \\[\nT = \\text{const.} \\times  e^{-\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}x}e^{i(-\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}x + \\omega t)}.\n\\] Now we take the real part, giving \\[\nT = A e^{-\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}x} \\cos\\left(-\\sqrt{\\omega/(2\\kappa)}x + \\omega t\\right),\n\\tag{12.1}\\] and we see that having set the constant to \\(A\\) the solution indeed satisfies \\(T(0, t) = A\\cos(\\omega t)\\).",

In actuality, water can turn to snow and ice and vice versa; since snow and ice have much higher albedo than open water, then we should consider \\(a = a(T)\\).\nLet us assume that there are two relevant ranges to consider: T &lt; 150K (cold) and T &gt; 280K (hot). Let us assume that the albedo is, in these two regions: \\[\na(T) \\approx\n\\begin{cases}\n0.7 & \\mathrm{if }\\ T &lt; 150\\mathrm{K}, \\\\\n0.3 & \\mathrm{if }\\ T &gt; 280\\mathrm{K}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\] The above guarantees that more energy is reflected if temperatures are low. To model this process, we can use a ramp function to specify the albedo over all temperatures: \\[\na(T) = A - B \\mathrm{tanh}\\left(k(T - 265)\\right).\n\\tag{13.2}\\] where \\(A = 0.5\\), \\(B = {\\color{blue}0.2}\\), \\(k = 0.1\\), and \\(T_0 = 265 \\mathrm{K}\\).

    "text": "13.2 Bifurcation diagram\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nDuring the lectures, the above script plotting the steady-state solutions will be examined in order to understand the effects of changing \\(Q\\).\nIt will be observed that dependent on the solar radiation, there may be one or three steady-state solutions. This leads to the following key bifurcation diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Bifurcation diagram of \\(Q/Q_0\\) vs \\(T^*\\)\n\n\n\nWe noted the following:\n\nThe system has three steady states, given by the green, red, and blue curves.\nThe middle state is unstable (shown dashed).\nThe system exhibits hysteresis. Note that if we decrease \\(Q/Q_0\\) past the tipping point, marked \\(Q_{T1}\\) in the image, then we would evolve to the lower stable steady state (which is the ice state). However, while we are in the ice stated, if we were to attempt to increase the solar radiation to return to the green branch, we would need to arrive at \\(Q_{T2}\\) to do so; this irreversibility is known as hysteresis. ## Dynamics and phase line solutions\n\nThe full time-dependent model is given by \\[\nC \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = f(T),\n\\] so we may use the positivity or negativity of \\(f\\) in order to sketch the time-dependent behaviour of the system.\nTo see this, we can perform an asymptotic analysis near the fixed points. Let the initial condition be considered near the fixed point: \\[\nT(t = 0) = T^* + \\delta,\n\\] where \\(\\delta \\ll 1\\). Then we expand the solution into an asymptotic expansion, \\[\nT(t) = T^* + \\delta T_1(t) + \\delta T^2(t) + \\ldots\n\\] Substitution into the above ODE gives, at \\(O(\\delta)\\), \\[\nC \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_1}{\\mathrm{d}t} = f'(T_0) T_1,\n\\] and hence, with \\(T_1(0) = 1\\), we have \\[\nT_1(t) = e^{f'(T_0) t/C}.\n\\] Therefore, depending on the positivity or negativity of the gradient function, the perturbation will either decay or grow as \\(t\\to\\infty\\).\nIt can then be verified that the centre equilbria is unstable while the other two are stable. The higher temperature corresponds to the one that the Earth is currently in, but according to this model, there seems to be the possibility of a colder climate (50 degrees colder) where the Earth is entirely covered with snow and ice.\nInterestingly, there is some evidence that the Earth’s climate may have been in this so-called state up to four times between 750 million and 580 million years ago (Neoproterozoic age). Observations of geological deposits suggest that the Earth has undergone periods of complete global glaciation where there have been very minimal biological activity. During this period, there is a massive build-up of CO2 in the atmopshere, leading to huge greenhouse effect. As \\(\\gamma\\) decreases in our model, the equilibrium can then shift, suddenly transitioning the Planet into the warm state.",

Note that the ice boundary \\(y_s\\) is an unknown to be determined by the model.\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nys = 0.7\ny = np.array([0, ys-0.0001, ys, ys+0.0001, 1])\nai = 0.62; aw = 0.32; \na = np.piecewise(y, [y &lt; ys, y == ys, y &gt; ys], [aw, 0.5*(aw+ai), ai])\nplt.plot(y, a, '-o') \nplt.xlabel('y'); plt.ylabel('a(y)');\nThe above forms what is referred to as a free-boundary problem, as the boundary \\(y = y_s\\) is solved as part of the model. Because \\(y_s\\) is essentially determined by where the temperature reaches the critical value, i.e. \\(T(y_s, t) = T_c\\), then the above albedo not only depends on latitude, but also on the current temperature distribution as well.",

In your problem set, you will develop the following equation (given by (Equation 25.3)): \\[\n\\bar{T}^* = \\frac{Q(1 - \\bar{a}) - A}{B}.\n\\tag{17.1}\\] The quantity \\(\\bar{a}\\) is given by integrating the albedo as follows: \\[\n\\bar{a} = \\int_0^1 s(y) a(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = a_i + (a_w {\\color{blue}-} a_i)y_s[1 - 0.241 (y_s^2 - 1)],\n\\tag{17.2}\\] which is given by (Equation 25.2). You may check that the above formula has the right signs by considering either the complete ice case (ice line at the equator \\(y_s = 0\\)) or the complete water/land case (ice line at \\(y_s = 1\\)).\nNow we return to the implicit equation for the temperature, which is given by (Equation 15.2) and repeated here: \\[\nT^*(y) = \\Phi(T^*) = \\frac{k\\bar{T}^* + Qs(y)(1 {\\color{red}-} a(y)) - A}{B + k}.\n\\] Substitute the mean temperature in, and this now yields \\[\nT^*(y) = \\frac{Q}{B + k} \\left[ s(y) [1 - a(y)] + \\frac{k}{B}(1 - \\bar{a})\\right] - \\frac{A}{B}.\n\\tag{17.3}\\] This ice line is then found by setting \\(T = T_C\\) at \\(y = y_s\\) in the above formula.

    "text": "18.2 Stability\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nSo far, we have only discussed the steady-state solutions of the latitude-dependent EBM, repeated below: \\[\nC \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t} = Qs(y)[1 - a(y)] - (A + BT) + k(\\bar{T} - T).\n\\] In this section, we investigate the stability analysis for the mean temperature, \\(\\bar{T}\\). This was given in Equation 25.1 and repeated below: \\[\nC \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = G(\\bar{T}) \\equiv Q(1 - \\bar{a}) - (A + B\\bar{T}),\n\\tag{18.1}\\] The following linearisation argument was presented by Cahalan and North (1979), with some additional details to avoid confusion. Let us linearise this about a steady-state solution, writing \\[\n\\bar{T} = \\bar{T}^* + u(t),\n\\] where \\(u \\ll 1\\). By Taylor series, \\[\nG(\\bar{T}) = G(\\bar{T}^*) + G'(\\bar{T}^*)u + O(u^2),\n\\] so substitution into the ODE yields the linear equation \\[\nC \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t} = G'(\\bar{T}^*) u.\n\\tag{18.2}\\] We need to calculate the derivative term on the RHS. First, using the equation for \\(G\\) in Equation 18.1, we have \\[\nG'(T^*) = -B - Q \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{a}}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T}}\\biggr\\rvert_{\\bar{T} = \\bar{T}^*}.\n\\tag{18.3}\\] The above calculation assumes that \\(Q\\) is a fixed number, as it should, since \\(Q\\) is regarded as a parameter (we choose a value of \\(Q\\), then this allows us to evolve the ODE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalahan & North’s “trick”\n\n\n\nThe following presentation took about 3 lines of text in the presentation of Cahalan & North (1979), between eqns (1.2) and (1.3) in the image below. Students have inquired about the manipulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.3: From Cahalan & North, p.1179\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is what to do with the derivative of \\(\\bar{a}\\) that appears in (Equation 18.3). This is a strange quantity, since \\(\\bar{a}\\) does not explicitly depend on \\(\\bar{T}\\), and is given in (Equation 17.2). The issue is that there is a hidden dependence: \\(\\bar{a}\\) depends on the ice line, \\(y_s\\), which depends on not only \\(Q\\), but is multivalued as well! \nCahalan & North, whether knowingly or unknowingly, applied a trick, which is to consider that \\(Q\\) is not a parameter, but that it can be viewed as depending on \\(\\bar{T}^*\\), the steady state (this dependence is shown in Figure 18.2). Therefore, Cahalan & North returned to the equation (Equation 17.1) that gives the steady-state: \\[\nT^* = \\frac{Q(1 - \\bar{a}) - A}{B}.\n\\] We differentiate this equation with respect to \\(\\bar{T^*}\\), but now assume both \\(Q\\) and \\(\\bar{a}\\) depend on \\(\\bar{T^*}\\). This yields \\[\n1 = \\frac{1}{B} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T^*}}(1 - \\bar{a}) - \\frac{Q}{B} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{a}}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T}^*} \\Longrightarrow\nB = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T^*}}(1 - \\bar{a}) - Q \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{a}}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T}^*}\n\\tag{18.4}\\]\nWe substitute the above value of \\(B\\) into (Equation 18.3), and then finally into the equation for the linearisation (Equation 18.2). Then we have \\[\nC \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\left[(1 - \\bar{a}) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T}^*}\\right]u(t) = -\\gamma u(t),\n\\] where the constant \\(\\gamma\\) has been defined by the above. Thus, the solution is given by \\[\nu(t) = u(0) e^{-\\gamma t/C}.\n\\]\nNote then that the crucial quantity is \\[\n\\gamma \\equiv (1 - \\bar{a}) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T}^*}.\n\\] If \\(\\gamma\\) is positive, the equilibrium point is stable, while if \\(\\gamma\\) is negative, the equilibrium is unstable. Because \\((1 - \\bar{a}) &gt; 0\\), then this yields the so-called slope-stability theorem coined by Cahalan and North (1979): \\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T}^*} &gt; 0 &\\Longrightarrow \\text{stable}, \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}\\bar{T}^*} &lt; 0 &\\Longrightarrow \\text{unstable}.\n\\end{align}\\]\nWe may now plot the bifurcation diagram, shown in \\((Q, \\bar{T})\\)-space. First, return to Figure 18.2. In lecture 21, we drew the following picture:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.4: Bifurcation diagram for \\((Q, \\bar{T})\\)\n\n\n\nNote the following characteristics.\n\nThere are up to four steady states (green, orange, two blacks).\nThose branches with positive gradient are stable; there is only one branch with a negative gradient and it is thus unstable. In the image, these are shown solid for stable and dashed for unstable.\nThe diagram indicates tipping points and hysteresis. As explained in the lectures, one can encounter a situation where, beginning from the upper orange branches, the solar radiation is decreased past the tipping point. The solution must then evolve to the lowermost stable state (green). However, increasing \\(Q\\) does not return us to the original non-frozen state—unless \\(Q\\) is increased by a massive amount. This ‘hysteresis’ loop is shown with the maroon colours in the image above.",

    "text": "19.1 Terminology and context\nThe ocean plays a significant role in regulating the Earth’s climate, as it acts as a massive heat sink and helps to distribute heat and moisture around the planet. In addition, carbon dioxide is water soluble, and through precipitation and wave motion, is transferred into the oceans. Thus the ocean acts as a sink, absorbing large amounts of this greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.\nThe thermohaline circulation (THC), also known as the global ocean conveyor belt, is a complex ocean circulation pattern that is driven by differences in water temperature and salinity. It is an important component of the Earth’s climate system, as it helps to distribute heat and other properties throughout the planet’s oceans.\nThe thermohaline circulation is driven by the sinking of cold, dense water in the polar regions, which then spreads out and flows towards the equator. As the water warms and becomes less dense, it rises to the surface and returns to the poles, creating a continuous loop of ocean currents. The role of salinity in driving the thermohaline circulation is due to the fact that the dissolved salts in seawater increase its density.\nThis circulation pattern has a significant impact on global climate, as it helps to regulate the exchange of heat and other properties between the oceans and the atmosphere. Changes in the thermohaline circulation, such as those caused by global warming, can have far-reaching effects on the planet’s climate and weather patterns.",

Mixing is a dominant effect due to wind and waves, and so the temperature in this region is mostly constant.\nThe thermocline region is the intermediate layer. Here, the temperature decreaes approximately linearly.\nThe deep abyssal zone comprises 98% of the total volume of the oceans. The temperature in this region is mostly constant, and a few degrees above freezing.\n\nWithin the intermediate region, the temperature can be modelled by an advection diffusion equation, \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t} + w \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T}{\\mathrm{\\partial}z} = \\kappa \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}^2 T}{\\mathrm{\\partial}z^2},\n\\tag{19.1}\\] where \\(w\\) is the upswelling velocity and \\(\\kappa\\) is the diffusion coefficient of the fluid.\nLet us assume that the temperature in this region is near steady state and that the upwards velocity is constant. Then we integrate the ODE to find \\[\nT(z) = T_0 + T_1 \\mathrm{e}^{-z/z^*},\n\\] where \\(T_0\\) and \\(T_1\\) are constants.

    "text": "19.5 A one-dimensional model (constant temperature)\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nConstruction and assumptions of the box model.\n\nWe consider two boxes, labeled ‘1’ and ‘2’, respectively via subscripts. Box 1 corresponds to high latitudes (near poles) and Box 2 to low latitudes (near equator). Each box has a corresponding temperature, \\(T_i\\), and salinity, \\(S_i\\). In each box, the temperature and salinities are well mixed, so they take different values in either box, in general.\nDifferences between the two boxes will drive a flow through the capillary pipe that connects the boxes at the bottom. A compensating flow at the surface ensures that the volume of water in each box does not change. Together, these two exchanges (top and bottom) represent the overturning circulation of the THC.\nWe assume (see above) that the strength of the exchange flow between the boxes is linearly proportional to their differences of temperature and salinity. In particular, let \\(\\rho_1\\) and \\(\\rho_2\\) be the two densities in the corresponding boxes. The flow \\(q\\) in the capillary pipe is driven by the difference \\[\nq = k \\frac{\\rho_1 - \\rho_2}{\\rho_0},\n\\tag{19.2}\\] where \\(k\\) is the hydraulic constant and takes the typical value of \\(k = 1.5 \\cdot 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\). The reference density \\(\\rho_0\\) is defined in conjunction with the equation of state.\nIn the normal state of the planet, \\(q &gt; 0\\) when the flow through the capillary goes in the direction of the equator as a result of higher densities at high latitudes.\nWe need an equation of state that connects the densities, \\(\\rho\\), with the temperature and salinities. This concerns the figure Figure 19.3. We assume that \\[\n\\rho = \\rho_0(1 - \\alpha(T - T_0) + \\beta(S - S_0)),\n\\tag{19.3}\\] where \\(T_0\\) and \\(S_0\\) are average values of temperature and salinity; \\(\\rho_0\\) is the density if \\(T = T_0\\) and \\(S = S_0\\); \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are constants with typical values \\(\\alpha = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{deg}^{-1}\\) and \\(\\beta = 8 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{psu}^{-1}\\). Combining (Equation 19.2) with (Equation 19.3) gives \\[\nq = k[ \\alpha(T_2 - T_1) - \\beta(S_2 - S_1)].\n\\tag{19.4}\\]\nExternal wind forces and Coriolis effects are ignored.\nWe assume that in each box, there is an exchange of heat and salinity to the surrounding environment. For instance, salinity will exchange due to evaporation, precipitation, and runoff. These will have constant of proportionalities of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) in the equations below.\nPrecipitation, evaporation, and runoff from the continents and atmosphere will also cause the salinity in either box to change. We therefore assume that this is modeled by a flux \\(H\\).\nRemember that in general, \\(T_2 &gt; T_1\\) (the temperatures at the equator are higher). Consequently, evaporation dominates Box 2; there is a net loss of salt-free moisture in the atmosphere and this causes a compensating virtual flux of salt, \\(H &gt; 0\\), into Box 2. At the same time, there is higher precipitation and runoff into Box 1 (due to lower temperatures), causing a net gain of salt-free moisture and therefore a loss of virtual salt, say \\(-H &lt; 0\\). We assume these two virtual salt fluxes sum to zero.\nNote that in the normal state of affairs, \\(S_2 &gt; S_1\\), and the lower latitude water is saltier than that of high latitudes.\n\nAn image of the box model is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.4: Two-box model of the North Atlantic with evaporation and precipitation. Image from (Kaper and Engler 2013)\n\n\n\nThe equations are given as follows. \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_1}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= c(T_1^* - T_1) + |q|(T_2 - T_1) \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_2}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= c(T_2^* - T_2) + |q|(T_1 - T_2) \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S_1}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= -H + d(S_1^* - S_1) + |q|(S_2 - S_1) \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S_2}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= H + d(S_2^* - S_2) + |q|(S_1 - S_2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{19.5}\\]\nNote that in the exchange terms corresponding to the flow \\(q\\) in the capillary pipes, we use an absolute value since it does not matter (flows are exchanged in both lower and upper pipes).\nNote also that \\(q = q(T_1, T_2, S_1, S_2)\\) as given in (Equation 19.4).",

The same conclusion can be drawn for the corresponding salinities.\nIt is then sensible to write all temperature and salinity in terms of this baseline scenario. So let us write \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_1 &= \\frac{1}{2}m + U_1, \\\\\nT_2 &= \\frac{1}{2}m + U_2,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where \\(m = T_1^* + T_2^*\\).

Then setting the right hand sides of (Equation 20.2) to zero and solving, we find \\[\nx^* = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta + |f^*|} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\ny^* = \\frac{1}{1 + |f^*|}.\n\\tag{20.4}\\] We can solve for \\(f^*\\) in both equations and equate the result to one another. This gives \\[\n\\delta \\frac{1-x^*}{x^*} = \\frac{1 - y^*}{y^*} = |f^*|.\n\\] Therefore the equilibrium points lie along the above curve. Let us generate different values of \\(f^*\\) and plot the combination.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndelt = 1/6\nfmat = np.linspace(1e-3, 10, 101)\nxs = delt/(delt + np.abs(fmat))\nys = 1/(1 + np.abs(fmat))\nplt.plot(xs, ys, '.-')\nplt.xlim((0,1))\nplt.ylim((0,1))\nplt.xlabel(\"$x^*$\"); plt.ylabel(\"$y^*$\");\nplt.grid(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above shows the steady-state values at \\(\\delta = 1/6\\). Each point refers to a different value of \\(|f^*|\\). Note that as \\(|f^*| \\to \\infty\\), then \\((x^*, y^*) \\to (0, 0)\\) while as \\(|f^*| \\to 0\\), then \\((x^*, y^*) \\to (1,1)\\).\nNow the above does not tell us what equilibrium states will exist at a specific value of \\(\\delta\\) since it requires information about \\(f^*\\). We take (Equation 20.3) and combine with (Equation 20.4). We conclude that the equilibrium points must satisfy \\[\n\\lambda f^* = \\phi(f^*),\n\\] where we have defined the function \\(\\phi\\) according to \\[\n\\phi(f^*) = \\frac{\\delta R}{\\delta + |f^*|} - \\frac{1}{1 + |f^*|}.\n\\tag{20.5}\\] Therefore, for each combination of the parameters \\((\\lambda, \\delta, R)\\), we must solve \\(\\delta f^* = \\phi(f^*)\\) to determine \\(f^*\\). Once the values of \\(f^*\\) are known, then the steady-states \\((x^*, y^*)\\) are also known.

In particular, it is possible, according to these models, for the flow directions to entirely change!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted by (Kaper and Engler 2013):\n\n\n\n“Clearly, two-box models are only a caricature of the THC. At best, they account for the pole-to-equator circulation in single ocean basin (the North Atlantic). They certainly do not account for the fact that all the Earth’s oceans are connected, nor for the fact that the oceans are coupled to the atmosphere and other components of the climate system. Nevertheless, the finding that such simple models predict the possibility of two distinct stable modes of circulation, and that transitions from one more to another can be induced by changing the forcing parameters [–] has had a significant impact in oceanography and climate science.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaper, Hans, and Hans Engler. 2013.

A source in the heat equation\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nConsider the same heat experiment discussed in Chapter 1 but now consider a bar that has an internal source or sink generating or removing heat, such as the case of a boiler with an internal heating element. By adapting a similar derivation to the one presented, explain why the modified conservation of heat equation is \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t} \\int_a^b \\rho c T \\, \\mathrm{d}x = q(x = a, t) - q(x = b, t) + \\int_a^b R(x, t) \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\nIn addition:\n\nBy studying the dimensions of the other terms in the above equation, find what the dimensions of \\(R\\) are. What does \\(R &gt; 0\\) mean and \\(R &lt; 0\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the left, density has units kg/m^3, specific heat J/(kg K), and temperature K. But then dx has units of m. And d/dt has units of 1/s. So altogether, we have the following SI units on the left: \\[\n\\frac{J}{m^2 \\cdot s}\n\\]\nSo its energy per unit area per unit time. The reason why it’s per unit area is because you have not integrated over the sides of the cylinder/bar.\nSo therefore this needs to match the units on the right, which are [R] [dx]. So you conclude that \\[\n[R] = \\frac{J}{m^3 \\cdot s}\n\\] i.e. energy per unit time per unit volume. This is energy density.\nR &gt; 0 means heat is added into the system (source). R &lt; 0 means heat is removed from the system (sink).\n\n\n\n\nHence derive the partial differential equation that governs the temperature \\(T\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe derivation follows exactly as in the notes, except you have an additional term on the RHS. Use Fourier’s law to convert \\(q = -k \\partial T/\\partial x\\). Write everything under the integral and this yields: \\[\n\\rho c \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t} = k \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}^2 T}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x^2} + R.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nBy introducing the appropriate scalings on each of the variables, \\(x\\), \\(t\\), and \\(T\\), non-dimensionalise the PDE and discuss the non-dimensional parameters (there will be two).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSame derivation as in the notes. Let \\[\nx = L x', T = [T]T' \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = [t]t'.\n\\] This time you will remember to scale out the typical source strength, so \\[\nR = [R]R'.\n\\]\nThis leads to \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t'}\n= \\left(\\frac{k[t]}{L^2 \\rho c}\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}^2 T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x'^2} + \\left(\\frac{[R][t]}{\\rho c [T]}\\right)R'.\n\\] So this gives the two sets of non-dimensional numbers\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\Pi_1 &= \\frac{k[t]}{L^2 \\rho c} \\\\\n\\Pi_2 &= \\frac{[R][t]}{\\rho c [T]}.\n\\end{align}\\]\nIf you want, you can write it in the alternative form by taking the time scaling to be \\([t] = L/U\\), where \\(U\\) is some unspecified velocity scale.\nFor the interpretation, you can simply take \\(\\Pi_1\\) to be a measure of diffusive effects (heat spreading out) and \\(\\Pi_2\\) to be a measure of source strength. Note that this problem can be simplified even further by choosing the time scale so as to set \\(\\Pi_1 = 1\\). If you do this, you will be left with a single non-dimensional parameter that balances diffusion with the strength of the source.",

    "text": "Q4. The unique timescale in the heat equation\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nDuring our investigation of the heat equation, we found that it was possible to scale time so as to scale out the only non-dimensional parameter that appears in the PDE. As explained in lectures, the disappearance of all non-dimensional parameters is due to the fact that only a single sensible timescale exists.\nBy adjusting the boundary conditions, we may create a new problem involving heat flow where a unique ‘special’ timescale can no longer be chosen.\nConsider a system where one side of the rod is heated in some periodic fashion, e.g. set the initial and boundary conditions to be \\[\\begin{align}\nT(x, 0) &= T_0 \\\\\nT(0, t) &= T_a \\cos (\\omega t), \\\\\nT(L, t) &= T_b.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nWhat must the units of \\(\\omega\\) be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nNote \\(\\omega t\\) must be unitless. Therefore \\([\\omega] = 1/s\\).\n\n\n\n\nNon-dimensionalise as usual and, without selecting the timescale, \\([t]\\), identify the key non-dimensional parameters that remain. Write a brief sentence to describe their physical interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is exactly the same as in the above heat question. You will still obtain\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t'}\n= \\Pi_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}^2 T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x'^2}\n\\] where the non-dimensional parameters is the Peclet number introduced in lectures: \\[\n\\Pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{k[t]}{L^2 \\rho c}\\right).\n\\]\nThe main difference is that now, your boundary conditions are \\[\nT'(0, t') = \\Pi_3 \\cos (\\Pi_2 t') \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\nT'(1, t') = \\Pi_4\n\\] where \\[\n\\Pi_2 = \\omega [t], \\qquad \\Pi_3 = \\frac{T_a}{T_0}, \\qquad Pi_4 = T_b/T_0.\n\\]\nThe scaling on the temperature was taken to be such that the final initial condition is set to unity: \\[\nT'(x', 0) = 1.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nThere are two sensible choices for setting the timescale, \\([t]\\). Identify the two choices and present the reduced set of equations in each case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there are now two ways of choosing the time scale. Either choose it to set \\(\\Pi_1 = 1\\) or choose it to set \\(\\Pi_2 = 1\\). In the former choice, you are choosing to set time according to the diffusive rate. In the latter, you are setting time according to how the boundary is heated.",

    "text": "Q5. Timescale in the surface energy\n\\(\\nextSection\\)\nTake the basic zero-dimensional energy model studied in (Equation 3.7) for the temperature of the troposphere: \\[\nc \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{4} Q(1 - a) - \\sigma \\gamma T^4.\n\\]\n\nNon-dimensionalise the model by choosing \\(T = [T]T'\\), \\(t = [t]t'\\), and \\(Q = [Q]Q'\\). Show that it is possible to select the scalings on the temperature and time so as to completely remove all constants from the problem when \\(Q\\) is assumed to be constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question’s suggestion of setting \\(Q = [Q]Q'\\) was excessive since \\(Q\\) is just a constant in this case. So proceeding as usual:\nSet in the scalings. This time it is easier to balance the right had-side first. \\[\n\\frac{c[T]}{[t']}\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t'} = \\left(\\frac{Q(1-a)}{4}\\right) - \\left(\\sigma \\gamma [T]^4\\right) T'^4.\n\\] So select the temperature scaling so that both coefficients on the RHS are equal. \\[\n[T] = \\left(\\frac{Q(1-a)}{4\\sigma \\gamma}\\right)^{1/4}.\n\\] Now choose the time scaling also to match the LHS coefficient to the RHS coefficient. \\[\nc \\frac{[T]}{[t]} = \\sigma \\gamma [T]^4 \\Longrightarrow\n[t] = \\frac{c}{\\sigma \\gamma [T]^4}\n\\] Once you have done this, the equation transforms to the one given in part b.\n\n\n\n\nThus, show that the analysis of the above equation is equivalent to studying \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 1 - T^4,\n\\] where we have dropped the primes and assumed that the albedo is such that \\(1 - a \\neq 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nDone above.\n\n\n\n\nFrom your choice of \\([t]\\), estimate the typical dimensional value using \\(d \\approx 10 \\mathrm{km}\\), \\(\\rho \\approx 1 \\mathrm{kg} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\), \\(c_p \\approx 10^3 \\mathrm{J} \\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\\).\n\nUse a pocket calculator to verify your calculations and conclude that this time-scale is on the order of a month. What is the relevance of this approximation as it concerns the steady-state solution?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow (Equation 3.7), we defined \\(C = \\rho c_p d\\). So the scaling on time is (put in the scaling for [T]): \\[\n[t] = \\left(\\frac{4}{(1-a)}\\right)^{3/4} \\left(\\frac{C}{(\\sigma \\gamma)^{1/4} Q^{3/4}}\\right).\n\\]\nSo we know that \\(\\sigma = 5.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\) J/(m^2 s K^4), \\(Q = 1.38 \\times 10^3\\) J/(m^2 s). We can also calculate \\[\nC = \\rho c_p d = 10^7 J/(K \\cdot m^2).\n\\]\nWe can use \\(\\gamma = 1\\) for an estimate. The right-most factor is \\[\n\\frac{10^7}{(5.67 \\times 10^{-8})^{1/4} (1.378 \\times 10^3)^{3/4}} s = 2.88 \\times 10^6 s\n\\]\nIf we use a = 0.3 then this gives a total of \\[\n[t] = 3.7 \\times 2.88 \\times 10^6 s.\n\\] To convert to days, note 1 day = 24 hours = 2460 minutes = 2460*60 seconds. This is then \\[\n[t] = \\frac{1.65 \\times 10^7}{8.64 \\times 10^4} \\text{days} = 0.19 \\times 10^3 \\text{days} = 190 \\text{days}.\n\\] So on the order of 6 months. Any answer you get that’s roughly on the order of months sounds about right. This is the rough approximation of how long time-scale effects take to appear.",

Find a one-term asymptotic expansion of the solution for small \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, note that \\[\n(1 + \\epsilon y)^{\\alpha} = 1 + \\alpha (\\epsilon y) + O(\\epsilon y)^2.\n\\]\nYou will not need more terms than that.

This gives, for the leading terms \\[\\begin{gather}\ny_0'' = -1 - \\alpha y_0' \\\\\ny_0(0) = 0 \\\\\ny_0'(0) = 1\n\\end{gather}\\] To solve this, you will need to refresh your memory on second-order differential equations learned in 2nd year. You can see Chapter 30 for references. To solve this set \\(y_0 = e^{rt}\\) and solve for \\(r\\) for the homogeneous equation. You will get \\[\ny_{\\text{homogeneous}} = (c_1 + c_2 e^{-\\alpha t}).\n\\] From here, we need a particular solution. This can be obtained by guessing (also see this reference). If we guess \\[\ny_p = C t,\n\\] we see that \\[\ny_p'' + \\alpha y_p' = \\alpha C = -1\n\\] implies \\(C = -1/\\alpha\\). Therefore the general solution is \\[\ny_0 = (c_1 + c_2 e^{-\\alpha t}) - \\frac{t}{\\alpha}.\n\\] We now select the constants to satisfy the initial conditions. This yields \\[\nc_1 + c_2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n-\\alpha c_2 - 1/\\alpha = 1,\n\\] from which the solution can be easily derived. It is \\[\ny(t) \\sim \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)e^{-\\alpha t} - \\frac{t}{\\alpha}.\n\\]\nThe solution of \\(y_1\\) proceeds in the same way, but since we did not anticipate that this question would be so algebraically involved, we will not require solving for \\(y_1\\). This can be left as an exercise if you so wish.\n\n\n\n\n(Challenging) Is the effect of the air resistance to increase or decrease the flight time? Justify based on your analytical solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above solution seems quite strange. After all, when \\(\\alpha = 0\\), we know that parabolic motion is expected. We found previously that \\[\ny_{\\alpha = 0}(t) \\sim -\\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t.\n\\] which matches our intuition about the expected flight being parabolic. However, notice that if \\(\\alpha\\) is small, we can expand the exponential, \\(e^{-\\alpha t} = 1 - \\alpha t + \\ldots\\). Substitution into the derived formula for \\(y_0\\) gives \\[\n\\color{blue}y(t) \\sim \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)\\left[1 - \\alpha t + \\ldots\\right] - \\frac{t}{\\alpha}.\n\\] We can now simplify the expression and we see that the \\(\\alpha \\to 0\\) limit is not problematic, because it now becomes: \\[\ny_0 \\sim \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t\\right) + \\alpha \\frac{1}{6} \\left(-3t^2 + t^3\\right) + O(\\alpha^2),\n\\] and the previous terms that we believed might tend to infinity as \\(\\alpha \\to 0\\) cancel. Inspecting the above solution, notice that the leading-order result agrees with the previously derived result for \\(\\alpha = 0\\). The next term shows the small effect of drag.\nYou can simply plot the curves and show the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.3: With (solid) and without damping (dashed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the dashed line brings down the parabolic path initially.",

We know that \\[\nf'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h},\n\\] provided the limit exists. Therefore, a simple idea to approximating the value of \\(f'(x)\\) is to use a small numerical value for \\(h\\), and calculate (the gradient of the secant line), \\[\nf'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h},\n\\] where \\(h\\) is a specified small number. The above is known as the two-point forward-difference formula. In fact, we can determine exactly the error of such an approximation via Taylor’s theorem. If \\(f\\) is twice continuously differentiable, then \\[\nf(x + h) = f(x) + h f'(x) + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''(c),\n\\] for some point \\(c\\in [x, x+h]\\).

It also comes up in the second-year Vectors and PDEs course.\n\n\nThe Jacobian matrix, \\(\\mathbf{J}\\), of a vector function, \\(\\mathbf{F}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m\\), \\[\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\nf_1(\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\nf_2(\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nf_m(\\mathbf{x})\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\] is the matrix of all its first-order partial derivatives, \\[\n\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}f_1}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x_2} & \\cdots &\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}f_1}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x_n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}f_m}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x_1} & \\cdots &\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}f_m}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x_n}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\nabla f_1(\\mathbf{x})^T \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\nabla f_n(\\mathbf{x})^T\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] We can essentially think of the Jacobian as the multi-dimensional extension of the basic derivative. It encodes all of the (first-order) information about the rate-of-change of the function.\nIt is interesting and important to consider the numerical evaluation of the Jacobian, in the event that the function \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) cannot be easily differentiated exactly. The simplest algorithm is based on approximating each entry of the matrix by a finite difference.\nFor example, let us consider approximating \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}f_i}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x_j}(\\mathbf{x}_0).\n\\] We define the \\(j\\)th unit vector by \\(\\mathbf{e}_j = [0 \\, 0 \\, \\cdots \\, 1 \\, \\cdots \\, 0]\\), which the \\(j\\)th entry being one and all entries being zero. Then we can approximate the derivative by a central difference, \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}f_i}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x_j}(\\mathbf{x}_0) \\approx \\frac{f_i(\\mathbf{x}_0 + \\mathbf{e}_j h) - f_i(\\mathbf{x}_0 - \\mathbf{e}_j h)}{2h},\n\\] where \\(h\\) is a small step size.\nLet us test this by calculating the Jacobian for \\[\n\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\nx_1^2 \\\\\nx_2^2 \\\\\nx_1 x_2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\] The pseudocode for this looks like this\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudocode for numerical Jacobian\n\n\n\nInput: function F (size m), point x (size n), step size h\n1.

    "text": "35.1 Variable scope\nDuring the 27 Feb 2024 lecture, the question of variable scope came up. Firstly, here is what ChatGPT says:\nSo indeed it looks like Python uses a scheme where if a variable is not locally declared, it will use values of the variable outside of the function. This can allow us to produce this kind of thing:\ndef myfunc():\n    print(a)\n\na = 1\nmyfunc()\na = 2\nmyfunc()\na = 3\nmyfunc()\n\n1\n2\n3\nSo I was wrong! Python variables are global when defined outside the function! Here is a reference.\nThis is certainly easier to use! However it can lead to confusion because for very complex codes, you may not be sure what value of a variable is being used within a function. Because most of the programming you will do in this course is very simple, this is unlikely to lead to trouble.\nIt’s generally good to avoid this whenever it is possible, though. For instance in this particular case, it makes much more sense to pass in the variable.\ndef myfunc(a):\n    print(a)\n\na = 99\nmyfunc(1)\nmyfunc(2)\nmyfunc(3)\n\n1\n2\n3\nIn the above case, the a that appears in the function is different from the a that is declared outside the function. This makes it very easy to understand what your function is doing without knowing what is happening outside of it.\nFor example, there is no danger of values being reset:\ndef myfunc(a):\n    a = a + 1000\n    print(a)\n\na = 99\nmyfunc(1)\nmyfunc(2)\nmyfunc(3)\nprint(a)\n\n1001\n1002\n1003\n99",

For the inner region, we take \\(\\epsilon \\ll X \\ll 1\\), and for the outer region, we take \\(X = O(1)\\).
