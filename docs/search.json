As mathematicians, we also have a unique perspective, and applied mathematics plays important roles in many of the above categories.\nIn essence, this course will include topics and themes are united by aspects of mathematical modelling and mathematical analysis and this is what distinguishes our style of study from adjacent areas of science and social science.\nWe will study so-called conceptual or box models of the climate. This involves some of the blue elements of the above figure, and thus we use coarse-grained models of describing the climate. This will involve applying some of the dynamical systems (phase-plane analysis of ODEs) you have learned previously, along with new methods of computation and analysis. The source for this part of the course will be (Kaper and Engler 2013).\nA secondary part of this course will involve more in-depth analysis of the physical models that govern the blue elements of the above figure. This moves us from the toy box models studied above to digging into the underlying physics—this also falls into the category of Mathematical Geoscience. For example, we will use partial differential equations to study the atmosphere and develop a deeper understanding of greenhouse gases.

    "text": "1.1 Derivation of the 1D heat equation\nIn order to demonstrate some of the basic principles of this course, let us demonstrate the derivation of the heat equation. We are interested in modelling the heat in a volume, \\(V\\), which, for the sake of concreteness is given by a long cylinder with its axis along \\(x \\in [0, L]\\). We assume that the side walls of the cylinder are insulated and the temperature only varies along the \\(x\\) direction.\nAt any point along this rod, the internal heat is given by \\(\\rho c T(x, t)\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the material (kg/m3), \\(c\\) is the specific heat capacity (J/(kg K)), and \\(T\\) is the temperature (K). Therefore, the heat energy along any segment in the rod is calculated from\nIf the heat changes, then the rate of change of heat energy is given the time derivative of the above quantity. By conservation of energy, any change of the internal energy must be equal to the inflow or outflow of heat at the ends, \\(x = a\\) or \\(x = b\\). We therefore write \\(q\\) for the flux (or flow) of heat.\nWe need a constitutive law that dictates how energy is exchanged at the boundaries. Based on intuition, it is sensible to assume that the flow of heat proceeds from hot to cold. For example, hot air rises towards cool air; or heat from a hot mug of tea flows and diffuses outwards into a cold room. Therefore, we write this as\nThis is known as Fourier’s law. The quantity \\(k\\) is the thermal conductivity, and its units are W/(m K). Because a Watt is a Joule/s, you can also see that the units of \\(k\\) are J/(m K s). The quantity \\(q\\) is the flux, and you can verify that it is given in units of J/(m2 s).\nTherefore by energy conservation, we have \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}  \\int_a^b \\rho c T \\, \\mathrm{d}x = q(x = b, t) - q(x = a, t),\n\\] i.e. the change in internal heat is equal to the flow through the ends. Substitution Fourier’s law, we can then write \\[\n\\int_a^b \\rho c \\frac{{\\partial}T}{{\\partial}t} \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_a^b k \\frac{{\\partial}^2 T}{{\\partial}x^2} \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\] Because the above integral identity needs to be true for all possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then it must be true everywhere (this is sometimes referred to as the du Bois-Reymond lemma or the bump lemma. Therefore we are left with the classic heat equation.\nIn order to produce a sensible physical solution, partial differential equations are typically supplemented by initial conditions and boundary conditions. The initial condition prescribes the state of the function at some initial time, typically \\(t = 0\\). Boundary conditions prescribe how the function behaves on the boundary of its domain, which in this case is \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = L\\). An example might be\nwhich expresses, respectively, that the temperature starts from a constant temperature, \\(T_0\\), and where the ends of the rod are kept at temperature \\(T_a\\) and \\(T_b\\).",

    "text": "1.2 Deriving the 1D transport (continuity) equation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024 note\n\n\n\nThis was a new addition in 2024.\n\n\nConsider the mass transport of some substance with density \\(\\rho(x, t)\\), immersed in a fluid, along a one-dimensional line in \\(x\\). If desired, you may consider the substance as existing in three-dimensional space, and propagating along the \\(x\\)-direction, with its behaviour independent of \\(y\\) and \\(z\\). Initially, when considered at time \\(t\\), the mass of the substance between two points, \\(a\\), and \\(b\\), is:\n\\[\nm_\\text{blob}(t) = \\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \\rho (x, t) \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\nAs time increases the particles of the substance will move due to the fluid moving; at the same time, the fluid volume which is initially contained in \\(x\\in [a(0), b(0)]\\) will also move. We want to find how the mass of the blob changes in time, and hence consider the quantity \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_\\text{blob}}{\\mathrm{d}t}  = \\int_a^b \\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} \\, \\mathrm{d}x + \\rho(b, t) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}b}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\rho(a, t) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}a}{\\mathrm{d}t}.\n\\]\nThe above considers the intrinsic rate of change of the function within the integrand, but then adds the extra mass due to the right boundary shifting rightwards (\\(b\\)) and subtracts the mass due to the left boundary shifting rightwards (\\(a\\)). It is known as the Leibniz integral rule. We can thus write this within the integral as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_\\text{blob}}{\\mathrm{d}t}  = \\int_a^b \\left[ \\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x} \\left(\\rho(x, t) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right) \\right] \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\nHowever, the quantity \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\equiv u(x, t)\n\\]\nrepresents the velocity of the fluid (which for the moment we assume to be a known and provided quantity). Therefore we can write the mass change as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_\\text{blob}}{\\mathrm{d}t}  = \\int_a^b \\left[ \\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x} \\left(\\rho u\\right) \\right] \\, \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\nThis result, which explains how to pass a derivative through an integral express mass of a substance within a flow is known as the Reynolds Transport Theorem. We have just derived it in 1D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReynolds Transport Theorem\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\rho = \\rho(x, t)\\) be some quantity (such as density) that is advected along a one-dimensional line in \\(x\\) due to a fluid with velocity \\(u(x, t)\\). Then \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \\rho \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \\left[ \\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x}(\\rho u)\\right] \\mathrm{d}x.\n\\]\n\n\nWe may now consider the substance being transported along the \\(x\\)-direction. If there is no interior creation or destruction of the source, then by conservation of mass, it must be the case that \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_\\text{blob}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0.\n\\]\nThus, again since the above integral identity applies to all possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it must be the case that the integrand is zero. Thus we conclude with the so-called tranport equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne-dimensional transport equation\n\n\n\nThe transport of a substance described by \\(\\rho(x, t)\\) advected along a one-dimensional line in \\(x\\) due to a fluid with velocity \\(u(x, t)\\) is given by \\[\n\\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x}(\\rho u) = 0.\n\\]\n\n\nAgain, we must consider the above problem in combination with potential initial conditions and boundary conditions. For instance, we might specify that the substance begins from some initial state, say \\[\n\\rho(x, 0) = \\rho_0(x).\n\\]\nThe boundary conditions are more subtle. It is not always obvious what the boundary conditions should be on a problem.\nHere is an example of a solution of such a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear advection equation with constant speed\n\n\n\nSolve the problem given by \\[\n\\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}t} + c\\frac{{\\partial}\\rho}{{\\partial}x} = 0,\n\\] where the velocity \\(u = c\\) is constant. You may assume the initial condition is given by \\[\n\\rho(x, 0) = \\rho_0(x) = e^{-x^2}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nThe general solution is given by \\[\n\\rho(x, t) = F(x - ct),\n\\] where \\(F\\) is an arbitrary (differentiable) function. You can verify this via the chain rule, noting that \\[\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial t} = -c F'(x - ct) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = F'(x - ct).\n\\] Applying the initial condition at \\(t = 0\\) gives \\(F(x) = \\rho_0(x)\\) and thus \\[\n\\rho(x, t) = e^{-(x - ct)^2}.\n\\]\nYou may plot this to discover that it is, as perhaps expected, a Gaussian profile moving to the right at constant speed (for \\(c &gt; 0\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFowler, Andrew. 2011.

    "text": "2.3 Returning to the heat equation\nExact units are not relevant for dynamics, and it is instead the ratio of units that we care about. To apply this principle, let us non-dimensionalise the equation Equation 1.1. We introduce typical scales for each of the variables. For example, we non-dimensionalise the temperature and distance by setting \\[\nT = T_0 T' \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = L x',\n\\] where primes now denote non-dimensional quantities. Since it is not clear how to scale time, we set \\(t = [t] t;'\\) and choose the scale later. Substitution into the equation now yields \\[\\begin{gather}\n\\frac{\\rho c T_0}{[t]}\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t'} = \\frac{kT_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}^2 T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x'^2}, \\\\\nT(x, 0) = 1 \\\\\nT(0, 0) = \\frac{T_a}{T_0}, \\\\\nT(L, 0) = \\frac{T_b}{T_0}.\n\\end{gather}\\]\nIt is useful to think of time in terms of velocity and distance. Let us then write \\[\n[t] = L/U,\n\\] where \\(U\\) is a typical velocity scale (which again, we shall specify later). Then note that the heat equation can be written as \\[\n\\frac{\\rho c}{(L/U)} \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t'} = \\frac{k}{L^2}\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}^2 T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x'^2}.\n\\] We can move all the units to one side and then write \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t'} =\\text{Pe} \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}^2 T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x'^2}.\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nWe can verify that the quantity \\[\n\\mathrm{Pe} =  \\frac{k/(\\rho c L^2)}{U/L} = \\frac{\\text{diffusive timescale}}{\\text{advective timescale}}.\n\\] known as the Peclet number is entirely non-dimensional. This number essentially charactises the balance between diffusive effects (which causes heat to spread out) versus advective effects (the transport of the heat). In the case of our problem, there is no obvious source of advection. Another way to see this is that the temporal or velocity scale is entirely free for us to select.\nWe can now choose the temporal scale so as to simplify the equation. Let us choose \\[\n[t] = \\frac{L}{U} = \\frac{\\rho c L^2}{k}.\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nNow the system simplifies. We can now write\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}t'} = \\frac{\\mathrm{\\partial}^2 T'}{\\mathrm{\\partial}x'^2} \\\\\nT'(x', 0) = 1 \\\\\nT'(0, 0) = A, \\\\\nT'(1, 0) = B.\n\\end{gathered}\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nWe have gone from a system where we needed to consider six parameters to one where we only need to specify two (essentially, the ratio of the initial heat to the boundary values). Imagine you are an engineer at a thermal company, and asked to study the different possible configurations of heat in the above setup. If you were to blindly perform numerical computations, you would have had to set specific values for each of the six parameters.\nInstead, some mathematical analysis has demonstrated that the six-dimensional space of parameters can be simplified to a two-dimensional one—this is an enormous simplification.\nYour analysis has further identified the key non-dimensional parameter that appears in Equation 2.1. This demonstrates that it is not the individual values of \\(k\\), \\(\\rho\\), \\(c\\), … that matter, but rather their specific combination in the form of the Peclet number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFowler, Andrew. 2011.

    "text": "3.1 The basic energy model\nThe basic model is derived as follows.\nNote that the primary components of the global energy balance are radiative fluxes: we receive short-wave radiation (UV and visible light) from the Sun, and emit longwave radiation (infra-red) to space.\nFirst we consider incoming energy.\nNext we consider outgoing energy.\nNow combining the above equations, we have \\[\nE_{\\mathrm{in}} - E_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\pi R^2 Q (1 - a) - 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma \\gamma T^4,\n\\tag{3.5}\\] which gives the incoming energy per unit time.\nPutting in (Equation 3.5) and taking the limit of \\(\\Delta t \\to 0\\), we finally have a heat equation for the Earth’s temperature.\nThe above equation Equation 3.7 is time-dependent, but we may consider that the surface temperature, either over long-time or in an averaged sense, is dictated by the steady-state (time-independent) solution. Setting \\(\\mathrm{d}T/\\mathrm{d}t\\) to zero, we see that there is a unique steady-state given by \\[\nT = \\left(\\frac{Q(1-a)}{4\\sigma\\gamma}\\right)^{1/4}.\n\\]\nIf we take \\(Q \\approx 1370 \\,\\mathrm{W m}^{-2}\\), \\(a \\approx 0.3\\), \\(\\sigma \\approx 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{W} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\mathrm{K}^{-4}\\), we then get \\[\nT \\approx 255 \\mathrm{K} = -18^\\circ \\mathrm{C}.\n\\] under the assumption that \\(\\gamma = 1\\).

Later on in the course, we will develop a more rigorous model to predict such a \\(\\gamma\\) by studying the properties of the atmosphere.",

There is an additional multiplication by \\((1 - a)\\) where \\(a\\) is the planetary albedo, which characterises amount of energy reflected due to the surface properties. Light surfaces like snow will have high albedo, \\(a \\approx 0.9\\), while darker surfaces like the ocean have smaller albedo, \\(a \\approx 0.3\\). The global average albedo is \\(a \\approx 0.3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy from the Earth\n\n\n\nWe now wish to characterise the energy, \\(E_{out}\\), and in the case of Earth, this will correspond to longwave radiation (infra-red) emitted into space. All bodies characterised by a temperature, say \\(T_e\\), will emit radiation, \\(Q_e\\). As a model, we can consider \\(Q_e\\) to be given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that \\[\nQ_e = \\sigma T_e^4,\n\\tag{3.3}\\] where \\(\\sigma \\approx 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} W m^{-2} K^{-4}\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nNow although the Earth’s surface may emit radiation according to (Equation 3.3), some of this radiation will be absorbed by the atmosphere and reflected back. This is the greenhouse effect. As a consequence of the greenhouse gas, the surface temperature of the Earth, \\(T\\), will be larger than the effective emitting temperature, \\(T_e\\). For the moment, we model this as \\[\nT_e = \\gamma^{1/4} T_e,\n\\tag{3.4}\\] where \\(\\gamma &lt; 1\\) is a greenhouse gas factor, which depends on the properties of the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal heat energy\n\n\n\nDue to this incoming energy, the Earth will cool or heat in response. We need to know how the internal temperature of an object responds to an input in energy. The general formula is \\[\n\\text{Internal heat energy} = \\text{volume} \\times (\\rho c_p) \\times T.\n\\] The key quantity is the experimentally determined, \\(c_p\\), which corresponds to the specific heat capacity. It is given in the SI units of \\(\\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}\\), i.e. energy per unit mass per unit temperature. Note that this applied to a shell around the planet of thickness \\(d\\) in the atmosphere, and so the mass is given by \\[\n\\text{mass} = (4 \\pi R^2) d \\rho\n\\tag{3.6}\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the average density of the atmosphere. Let us imagine the increase in temperature, \\(\\Delta T\\),during an interval of time, \\(\\Delta t\\). You can now verify that \\[\n\\Bigl[ (4 \\pi R^2) d \\rho \\Bigr] c_p (\\Delta T)\n\\] returns the units of Joules—i.e. this is the internal energy produced during the time \\(\\Delta t\\). We then have \\[\n\\Bigl[ (4 \\pi R^2) d \\rho \\Bigr] c_p \\Delta T =  \\Delta t (E_{in} - E_{out}).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZero-dimensional model for the surface temperature of the Earth\n\n\n\nThe Earth’s temperature, as measured on a layer of thickness \\(d\\) at the troposphere is given by the following ordinary differential equation (ODE) for \\(T = T(t)\\): \\[\nC \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{4} Q(1 - a) - \\sigma \\gamma T^4,\n\\tag{3.7}\\] where we have defined \\[\nC = \\rho c_p d\n\\] as the heat capacity of the atmosphere. Above, the solar flux, Q is often taken to be \\(Q = 1370\\) W/m2, \\(\\sigma = 5.67 \\times 10^{-8}\\) W/(m2K4), and \\(\\gamma \\leq 1\\) is the greenhouse gas factor.",

As you can see, it is not as useful to specify that \\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\sin{x} = \\lim_{x\\to 0} x.\n\\] In contrast, (Equation 5.2) is much more prescriptive about the way that the functions are approaching the limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of \\(\\sim\\), \\(\\gg\\), and \\(\\ll\\)\n\n\n\nFirst, the notation \\[\nf(x) \\ll g(x), \\qquad x \\to x_0,\n\\] is read as “\\(f(x)\\) is much smaller than \\(g(x)\\) as \\(x \\to x_0\\)” and means \\[\n\\lim_{x\\to x_0} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0.  \n\\] We may analogously use \\(g(x) \\gg f(x)\\) for “much greater than”.\nSecond, the notation \\[\nf(x) \\sim g(x), \\qquad x \\to x_0,\n\\] is read as “\\(f(x)\\) is asymptotic to \\(g(x)\\) as \\(x \\to x_0\\)”, and means that the error between \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) tends to zero as \\(x \\to x_0\\), or \\[\n\\lim_{x\\to x_0} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1.  \n\\] We will often say “\\(f\\) is like \\(g\\)” or “\\(f\\) behaves like \\(g\\)”,\n\n\nHere are some examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sin x \\sim x \\sim \\tan x\\) as \\(x \\to 0\\)\n\\(x^2 + x + 1 \\sim \\dfrac{x^3 + \\sin x}{1 + x}\\) as \\(x \\to \\infty\\)\n\\(\\sin x \\ll \\cos x\\) as \\(x \\to 0\\)\n\n\n\nIn the examination of limiting processes, often the main issue of consideration is the relative sizes of quantities defined according to their powers.

However, we can estimate the solution in the limit \\(\\epsilon \\to 0\\). We expand the solution as \\[\ny(t) = y_0(t) + \\epsilon y_1(t) + \\epsilon^2 y_2(t) + \\ldots\n\\] In order to expand the denominator, you can use Taylor’s theorem to expand the function \\[\nf(x) = (1 + x)^\\alpha = f(0) + f'(0)x + \\ldots = 1 + \\alpha x + \\ldots\n\\] around \\(x = 0\\).\nThe differential equation now yields \\[\ny_0'' + \\epsilon y_1'' + \\epsilon^2 y_2'' + \\ldots = -\\left[1 - 2\\epsilon \\left(y_0 + \\epsilon y_1 + \\ldots\\right) + \\ldots \\right]\n\\] so grouping terms together order-by-order yields \\[\n\\Bigl[ y_0'' + 1 \\Bigr] + \\epsilon \\Bigl[ y_1'' - 2y_0\\Bigr] + \\ldots = 0.\n\\]\nWe can similarly substitute the expansion into the initial conditions. Altogether, at leading order, we obtain the following system to solve: \\[\\begin{align}\ny_0'' + 1 &= 0, \\\\\ny_0(0) &= 0, \\\\\ny_0'(0) &= 1.\n\\end{align}\\] Integrating twice and applying the boundary conditions gives us \\[\ny_0(t) = -\\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t.\n\\] In fact, this is simply the parabolic motion you would expect from school Physics. The \\(\\epsilon = 0\\) solution corresponds to assuming that the mass at the centre of the planet is dominant and then acceleration is constant.\nHowever, we can now proceed to higher order and examine the nonlinear effects. Proceeding to \\(O(\\epsilon)\\), we have the following system to solve: \\[\\begin{align}\ny_1'' &= 2y_0, \\\\\ny_1(0) &= 0, \\\\\ny_1'(0) &= 0.\n\\end{align}\\] Notice the boundary conditions come from the fact there are no \\(\\epsilon\\) corrections in the original boundary conditions, so \\(y_n(0) = y_n'(0) = 0\\) for all \\(n &gt; 0\\). Again this system is simple to integrate. Integrating the solution for \\(y_0\\) twice and substitution of the initial conditions yields \\[\ny_1(t) = -\\frac{1}{12}t^4 + \\frac{1}{3}t^3.\n\\] We have thus solved for the asymptotic approximation to two orders. We have \\[\ny(t) \\sim \\Bigl[ -\\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t\\Bigr] + \\epsilon \\Bigl[ -\\frac{1}{12}t^4 + \\frac{1}{3}t^3\\Bigr].\n\\] This was quite an accomplishment! We have taken a problem that was not easily solvable in explicit form and through fairly simple integrations, obtained an approximation to two orders in \\(\\epsilon\\). How good is it? Let us solve the problem numerically and compare with the asymptotic approximation.",

    "text": "8.1.1 The inner scaling\nOur intuition follows a very similar logic to the examination of the singular root in Section 5.1.1. Above, our naive assumption was that \\(\\epsilon T'(t)\\) could be ignored since \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small number. However, this may not be the case if the gradient is very large.\nOur intuition further suggests that the boundary layer occurs near \\(t = 0\\) and that it scales in size with \\(\\epsilon\\). Therefore, let us set \\[\nt = \\epsilon^{\\alpha} s,\n\\] as a change of coordinates. We expect \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\) (otherwise \\(t\\) is not small), and within this region, we expect the new coordinate, \\(s\\), to be \\(O(1)\\) (of moderate size). We then transform the unknown function: \\[\nT(t) = T(\\epsilon s) = U(s),\n\\] and seek a new differential equation for \\(U\\). By the chain rule, \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\epsilon^{-\\alpha} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}s}.\n\\] Before substituting into the equation, we are prudent to examine the behaviour of \\(R(t)\\) near \\(t = 0\\). We know by Taylor’s theorem that \\[\nR(t) = 1 + A \\left(1 - \\frac{t^2}{2} + \\ldots \\right).\n\\] Therefore, under the substitution, we may approximate \\(R\\) by its leading terms: \\[\nR( \\epsilon^{\\alpha} s) \\sim 1 + A.\n\\] For now, we will not need more terms than this. Substituting into the ODE now gives \\[\n\\epsilon^{1-\\alpha} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}s} \\sim \\Bigl[1 + A\\Bigr] - U.\n\\] Now in order to involve the first term, it is sensible to select \\[\n1 - \\alpha = 0 \\Longrightarrow \\alpha = 1.\n\\]\n\n\n8.1.2 The inner equation\nTherefore, the correct coordinate re-scaling was the ‘obvious’ one: \\[\nt = \\epsilon s.\n\\]\nSubstituting this again in (?eq-matched-T): \\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}s} &= 1 + A\\cos(\\epsilon s) - U, \\\\\nU(0) &= T^*.\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe procedure is now exactly the same. We expand \\[\nU(s) = U_0(s) + \\epsilon U_1(s) + \\epsilon^2 U_2(s) + \\ldots\n\\] At leading order, we get \\[\\begin{align}\nU_0' &= 1 + A - U_0 \\\\\nU_0(0) &= T^*.\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe above ODE can be solved by integrating factors. Multiplying both sides be \\(e^s\\), we have \\[\n(U_0 e^s)' = (1 + A)e^s.\n\\] Integrate and use the initial condition: \\[\nU_0(s) = (1 + A) + (T^* - (1 +A))e^{-s}.\n\\] This is exactly what we expect. Notice that \\[\n\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} U_0(s) = \\lim_{t \\to 0} T_{\\text{outer}}\n\\tag{8.1}\\] therefore the outer limit of our inner solution matches the inner limit of our outer solution. In terms of outer coordinates, our inner solution is approximated as follows: \\[\nT_{\\text{inner}} \\sim (1 + A) + (T^* - (1 +A))e^{-t/\\epsilon}.\n\\]\nLet’s finally plot this with our previous curves:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\nTs = 0\nep = 0.2\nA = 0.1\nf = lambda t, T: 1/ep*(1 + A*np.cos(t) - T)\n\ntmax = 20\nsol = solve_ivp(f, [0, tmax], [Ts], dense_output=True)\n\nt = np.linspace(0, tmax, 1000)\ny = sol.sol(t)\nplt.plot(t, y[0])\nplt.plot(t, 1 + A*np.cos(t), '--')\nplt.plot(t, (1 + A) + (Ts - (1 + A))*np.exp(-t/ep), '--')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt works beautifully!\n\n\n8.1.3 Summary\nLet us summarise the procedure of matched asymptotics.\n\nExpand the solution of the differential equation naively in the typical asymptotic expansion (e.g. in powers of \\(\\epsilon\\)).\nNotice that the approximation does not satisfy certain boundary conditions.\nRe-scale the coordinates in the ‘inner’ regions.\nDevelop an inner solution that satisfies the boundary condition.

    "text": "10.4 The unique timescale in the heat equation\nDuring our investigation of the heat equation, we found that it was possible to scale time so as to scale out the only non-dimensional parameter that appears in the PDE (the Peclet number). This produced (Equation 2.3). As explained in lectures, the disappearance of all non-dimensional parameters is due to the fact that only a single sensible timescale exists.\nBy adjusting the boundary conditions, we may create a new problem involving heat flow where a unique ‘special’ timescale in (Equation 2.2) can no longer be chosen.\nConsider a system where one side of the rod is heated in some periodic fashion, e.g. set the initial and boundary conditions to be \\[\\begin{align}\nT(x, 0) &= T_0 \\\\\nT(0, t) &= T_a \\cos (\\omega t), \\\\\nT(L, t) &= T_b.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nWhat must the units of \\(\\omega\\) be?\nNon-dimensionalise as usual and, without selecting the timescale, \\([t]\\), identify the key non-dimensional parameters that remain. Write a brief sentence to describe their physical interpretation.\nThere are two sensible choices for setting the timescale, \\([t]\\). Identify the two choices and present the reduced set of equations in each case.",

    "text": "10.5 Timescale in the surface energy\nTake the basic zero-dimensional energy model studied in (Equation 3.7) for the temperature of the troposphere: \\[\nC \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{4} Q(1 - a) - \\sigma \\gamma T^4.\n\\]\n\nNon-dimensionalise the model by choosing \\(T = [T]T'\\), \\(t = [t]t'\\), and \\(Q = [Q]Q'\\). Show that it is possible to select the scalings on the temperature and time so as to completely remove all constants from the problem when \\(Q\\) is assumed to be constant.\nThus, show that the analysis of the above equation is equivalent to studying \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 1 - T^4,\n\\] where we have dropped the primes and assumed that the albedo is such that \\(1 - a \\neq 0\\).\nFrom your choice of \\([t]\\), estimate the typical dimensional value using \\(d \\approx 10 \\mathrm{km}\\), \\(\\rho \\approx 1 \\mathrm{kg} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\), \\(c_p \\approx 10^3 \\mathrm{J} \\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}\\).\n\nUse a pocket calculator to verify your calculations and conclude that this time-scale is on the order of a month.
