<!-- ## Solution -->

<!-- The bifurcation diagram is shown below. Stable solutions are shown solid and unstable dashed.

## Q1. Non-dimensionalisation of the Stommel box model {.unnumbered}

Consider the Stommel box model given in (@eq-stommelpre). Non-dimensionalise the model in order to produce the set of equations given in (@eq-stommelsys), repeated here: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &= \delta(1 - x) - |f(x, y)|x, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} &= 1 - y - |f(x, y)|y, 
\end{aligned}
$$
where we have introduced the function,
$$
f(x, y; R, \lambda) = \frac{1}{\lambda}(Rx - y),
$$

Provide a brief description of the physical interpretations of the parameters $\lambda$, $\delta$, and $R$.  

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

The non-dimensionalisation procedure was done in the lecture notes and lectures. 

The final parameters were established by
$$
\delta = \frac{d}{c}, \qquad \lambda = \frac{c}{2\alpha k \Delta T^*}, \qquad R = \frac{\beta \Delta S^*}{\alpha \Delta T^*}.
$$ 
Their interpretations are as follows: $\delta$ measures the relative relaxation temporal rates of the salt-basin exchange and the temperature-basin exchange. Since thermal energy turns out to exchange on a faster time scale than salinity, then we are typically interested in $\delta \ll 1$. 

The parameter $\lambda$ is a measure of the strength of the THC. For example, with $k$ large, this corresponds to significant flow through the pipes connecting the boxes, and so $\lambda \to 0$ corresponds to strong THC. 

Finally $R$ allows us to compare the relative effects of temperature and salinity differences between the external basins. Salinity differences dominate if $R > 1$ and temperature differences dominate if $R < 1$.

## Q2. Investigations for $R$ {.unnumbered}

Using the script available on Noteable investigate the behaviour of the Stommel box model under changing values of $R$ and fixed values of the other parameters. Based on your intuition, what do you expect to be the features of the bifurcation diagram, as shown in the $(R, f)$-plane? 

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

Remember that the steady states are found by examining the intersections of the curves $\lambda f = \phi$. From (@eq-stommel-phi), we have
$$
\phi(f^*) = \frac{\delta R}{\delta + |f^*|} - \frac{1}{1 + |f^*|}.
$$
so essentially the effect of changing $R$ is to multiply the curve $\phi$ by a multiplier. Using the [code on the JupyterHub](https://maths.jupyterhub.bath.ac.uk/hub/user-redirect/lab/tree/courses/MA30287/notebooks/ps06_solution.ipynb) we obtain the following graph for different values of $R$.  

![Steady state intersections for Stommel's box model](img/2023-05-06-10-45-41.png){#fig-ps6-stommelint}

For the smallest values of $R$, note that only the lowermost steady state will be present. As $R$ crosses the critical value of $R = 1$, two intersections are borne at $\phi = 0$. Eventually $R$ crosses another critical value, and the two leftmost intersections merge then disappear, leaving only the largest steady-state. 

Because the stability of the solution is essentially given by the ordering of the curves (if the curve $\lambda f$ is larger than the curve $\phi$ on the left of the steady-states), then we can see that, as typical for stability in this course, the first and third steady states are stable, and the middle one unstable. 

We can now plot a bifurcation diagram using the above information.

## Q3. Alternative scalings of the Stommel box model {.unnumbered}

It is possible to scale the problem differently, and this may allow for simpler analysis. Consider the set of equations in Q1. Write instead
$$
x = [x] s, \qquad y = [y] \theta, \qquad t = [t] t',
$$ 
Choose the correct scalings, $[x]$, $[y]$, and $[t]$, so that we obtain a re-scaled version: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t'} &= 1 - (\epsilon + |q|) s, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t'} &= 1 - (\mu + |q|)\theta,
\end{aligned}
$$

where now the flow term is given by 
$$
q = \kappa(-\theta + \tilde{R}s).
$$ 
In addition to the choice of scalings, you will need to describe how the new parameters, $\epsilon$, $\mu$, $\kappa$, and $\tilde{R}$, are related to the older parameters.


:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

Putting in the scalings, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{[x]}{[t]}\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t'} &= \delta(1 - [x]s) - [x]|f(x, y)|s, \\
\frac{[y]}{[t]}\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t'} &= 1 - [y]\theta - |f(x, y)|\theta.
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing the equations, we see that we should choose
$$
[x] = \epsilon, \qquad \frac{\delta [t]}{[x]} = 1, \qquad [t] = \mu, \qquad [y] = [t] = \mu.
$$ 
Under this choice, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t'} &= 1 - \epsilon s - [t]|f(x, y)|s, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t'} &= 1 - \mu\theta - [t]|f(x, y)|\theta.
\end{aligned}
$$
The latter quantity is 
$$
\mu f = \frac{\mu[y]}{\lambda}\left(-\theta + \frac{R[x]}{[y]}s\right).
$$
We there write 
$$
\kappa =  \frac{\mu[y]}{\lambda}, \qquad \tilde{R} = \frac{R[x]}{[y]}
$$ 

Thus we have produced
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t'} &= 1 - \epsilon s - |q|s, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t'} &= 1 - \mu\theta - |q|\theta.
\end{align}
where
$$
q = \kappa(-\theta + \tilde{R}s). 
$$
