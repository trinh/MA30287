## Q1. A van der Pol equation {.unnumbered}
Consider the van der Pol equation for $x(t)$ with $0 < \epsilon \ll 1$: 
$$
\epsilon \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d}t^2} + (3x^2 - 6x - 9) \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} + 4x = 0.
$$ 

a. Determine $f(x)$ so that this equation can be written as a LiÃ©nard phase plane system in the form 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon \dot{x} &= f(x) + 4y, \\
\dot{y} &= -x. 
\end{aligned}
$$

b. For fixed $\epsilon > 0$, find the equilibrium point(s) in the phase plane, find their eigenvalues, and classify their linear stability. 

c. Use the expansions $x(t) = x_0(t) + \epsilon x_1(t) + O(\epsilon^2)$ to determine the equations for the leading-order slow solution. Sketch the slow manifold, indicate the directions motion on each part, and identify the two attracting points on the curve. 

d. Use the expansions $x(t) = X_0(T) + \epsilon X_1(T) + O(\epsilon^2)$ and $y(t) = Y_0(T) + \epsilon Y_1(T) + O(\epsilon^2)$ with $T = t/\epsilon$ to obtain the leading-order fast solution. 

e. Use the phase plane to determine the maximum and minimum values of $x(t)$ during an oscillation. Sketch $x(t)$ as a function of time. 

<!-- f. **(Challenge)** Using the time required for the slow motions in part c (neglecting the short times for the fast solutions in part d), determine the leading-order estimate for the period $P$  of oscillation for the limit cycle.  -->
<!---->
<!-- Hint: Find the time spent moving along each of the slow curves by obtaining an equation $\dot{x}_0 = g(x_0)$ from part c, and then separate variables to write  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \dot{x}_0 = g(x_0) \Longrightarrow P = \int_{t_{\text{start}}}^{t_{\text{end}}} \, \mathrm{d}t = \int_{x_{\text{start}}}^{x_{\text{end}}} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{g(x)}. -->
<!-- $$  -->
<!-- Finally, integrate over the ranges in $x$ that are appropriate to each of the slow segments, and add the result to obtain the period. -->

## Q2. Fast-slow dynamics with three variables {.unnumbered}

Consider the limit of $\epsilon \ll 1$ for each of the following cases. 

a. Consider the system 
$$
\begin{aligned}[c]
\dot{x} &= 2 - y, \\
\dot{y} &= x-z, \\
\epsilon\dot{z} &= y - y^2 + \frac{1}{3}y^3 - z, 
\end{aligned}
$$ 
with the initial conditions of $x(0) = 1$, $y(0) = 3$, and $z(0) = 0$. 

  (i) Identify the surface $z = S(x, y)$ that defines the slow manifold. 
  (ii) Find the equilibrium point of the leading-order slow phase plane system and show that it is asymptotically stable for $t \to \infty$. 
  (iii) Also determine the form of the initial layer that describes the transition from the initial conditions to the slow manifold.

b. Consider the system 
$$
\begin{aligned}[c]
\dot{x} &= 2 - y, \\
\epsilon\dot{y} &= x-z, \\
\dot{z} &= y - y^2 + \frac{1}{3}y^3 - z, 
\end{aligned}
$$ 
with the initial conditions of $x(0) = 0$, $y(0) = 3$, and $z(0) = 1$. 

  (i) Show that the slow manifold reduces to a curve that could be written in parametric form as $x = x(z), y = y(z), z = z$. 
  (ii) Determine the asymptotic solution for $t \to \infty$. 
  (iii) Also determine the form of the initial layer that describes the transition from initial conditions to the slow manifold.
