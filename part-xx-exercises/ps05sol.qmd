## Q1. Evolution {.unnumbered}

Consider again the basic time-dependent EBM given in (@eq-ps4-main). Let $T^*$ be a steady-state solution and set $T = T^* + u(t)$ where $u(t)$ is a small perturbation from the steady state.

a. Show that the perturbation satisfies 
$$
C \dot{u} = -D u + O(u^2).
$$
and hence solve for the general solution of the leading-order perturbation (ignoring quadratic terms). What are the conditions on $T^*$ so that the steady state is linearly stable?

b. Assuming $T^*$ is linearly stable, find the typical response time to a perturbation. For instance, what is the time it takes for the perturbation to reach the value $u(t) = 0$ if $u(0) = 1$? How does this response time change with $C$? What is the physical interpretation of this regarding the climate?

## Q2. Integral of energy over the planet {.unnumbered}

Ignoring the effects of albedo, the total radiation absorbed over the surface of the planet (per unit time) is given by 
$$
\iint_{\text{planet}} Qs(y=\sin\varphi) \, \mathrm{d}S.
$$
This is what is known as a surface integral (@sec-appendix-surfaceintegral). In the case of the spherical coordinate system, this is calculated by 
$$
\int_{\theta=0}^{2\pi} \int_{\varphi = -\pi/2}^{\pi/2} Qs(y = \sin\varphi) R_E^2 \cos\varphi \, \mathrm{d}\varphi \mathrm{d}\theta.
$$
Use the properties of $s(y)$ in (@eq-EBM-s) to conclude that the total radiation absorbed is $4\pi R_E^2 Q$.

## Q3. Mean temperature in the latitude-dependent EBM {.unnumbered}

Consider now the latitude-dependent EBM 
$$
C \frac{\mathrm{\partial}T}{\mathrm{\partial}t} = Qs(y)[1 - a(y)] - (A + BT) + k(\bar{T} - T).
$$ 
Recall the albedo is given by $a = a_i$ for $y > y_s$ and $a = a_w$ for $y < y_s$. 

a. By integrating the above equation over $y \in [0, 1]$, show that the mean temperature is given by 
$$
C \frac{\mathrm{d}\bar{T}}{\mathrm{d}t} = Q(1 - \bar{a}) - (A + B\bar{T}),
$$ {#eq-meanT-evo-ps}
where 
$$
\bar{a} = \int_0^1 s(y) a(y) \, \mathrm{d}y = \alpha_w \int_0^{y_s} s(y) \, \mathrm{d}y + a_i \int_{y_s}^1 s(y) \, \mathrm{d}y.
$$

$$
\bar{a} = a_i + (a_w - a_i) y_s[1 - 0.241(y_s^2 - 1)].
$$ {#eq-ps4-abar}
What is $\bar{a}$ in the two situations of a completely ice-covered world and an ice-free world?

## Q4. Sensitivity of the climate {.unnumbered}

Consider the equation for the global average temperature given in (@eq-meanT-evo-ps):
$$
C \frac{\mathrm{d}\bar{T}}{\mathrm{d}t} = Q(1 - \bar{a}) - (A + B\bar{T}).
$$
We would like to understand how the climate behaves under a small perturbation in the solar forcing. In general, though, the 'constants', $A$, $B$, and $\bar{a}$ will depend on $T$. For example, their values may have been calibrated under a static situation. Therefore, let $A = A(T)$, $B = B(T)$, and $\bar{a} = \bar{a}(T)$.

Below, we drop all bars for convenience. 

a. Consider a perturbation of the solar radiation, say $Q = Q_0 + \delta$ where $\delta$ is small in comparison to $Q_0$. Expand now the temperature into a series: 
$$
T = T_0 + \delta T_1  + \ldots
$$ 
Show that at $O(\delta)$, the perturbation is governed by 
$$
C \frac{\mathrm{d}T_1}{\mathrm{d}t} = (1 - a(T_0)) - B(T_0) T_1 - A'(T_0) T_1 - T_0 B'(T_0) T_1 - Q_0 a'(T_0) T_1.
$$ 


:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

Each of the functions should be expanded in the usual way. For example, from Taylor series we have
$$
A(T) = A(T_0) + A'(T_0)(T - T_0) + O(T - T_0)^2.
$$
Then using $T = T_0 + \delta T_1 + \ldots$, we have
$$
A(T) = A(T_0) + \delta A'(T_0) T_1 + O(\delta)^2.
$$
Do the same for both $a(T)$ and $B(T)$. Then substituting into the equation gives (remember to drop bars):
$$
\text{LHS} = \delta C \frac{\mathrm{d}T_1}{\mathrm{d}t} + O(\delta^2)
$$
while for the right hand-side

\begin{align}
\text{RHS} &= Q_0(1 - a(T_0)) - (A(T_0) + B(T_0) T_0) \\
& \quad + \delta \left[(1 - a(T_0)) - Q_0 a'(T_0)T_1  - A'(T_0)T_1 - B'(T_0)T_0 T_1 - B(T_0) T_1\right] + O(\delta)^2.
\end{align}

Now the first, $O(1)$, grouping of terms above is zero by assumption that $T_0$ is steady-state. So considering only those terms that are multiplied by $\delta$, we have
$$
C \frac{\mathrm{d}T_1}{\mathrm{d}t} = (1 - a(T_0)) - B(T_0) T_1 - A'(T_0) T_1 - T_0 B'(T_0) T_1 - Q_0 a'(T_0) T_1.
$$
:::


b. Consequently, show that the temperature perturbation can be written as 
$$
B(T_0) \tau \frac{\mathrm{\partial}T_1}{\mathrm{\partial}t} = [1 - a(T_0)]  - \frac{B(T_0)}{g} T_1,
$$ {#eq-T1eqpertb}
where

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau &= \frac{C}{B(T_0)} \\
g &= \frac{1}{1-f} \\
f &= f_1 + f_2 \\
f_1 &= \frac{1}{B(T_0)} \left(-T_0 B'(T_0) - A'(T_0)\right),\\
f_2 &= \frac{1}{B(T_0)} \left(-Q_0 a'(T_0)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The parameter $\tau$ measures the time scale of the climate system's thermal inertia. It involves the thermal inertia of the atmosphere and also the much larger inertia of the oceans. The factor $g$ is the climate gain; it amplifies any response to the radiative perturbation by a factor of $g$. Also $f_1$ incorporates the effect of water-vapor feedback and $f_2$ that of ice and snow albedo feedback. 


:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

There is nothing tricky about this, but it just requires keeping track of bookwork. On the right hand-side, separate those terms proportional to $T_1$ and write it in the desired form. Refer to the lecture videos where we completed this (modulo a possible sign!)
:::

c. Consider (@eq-T1eqpertb) at steady state, so therefore the perturbed equilibrium temperature is equal to 
$$
\delta T_1 =  \frac{[1 - a(T_0)] \delta g}{B(T_0)}.
$$ 
If the CO~2~ level in the atmosphere doubles, then the radiative forcing might be adjusted as: 
$$
(1 - a(T_0)) \delta = 3.7 \,  \mathrm{W} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-2}. 
$$ 
Assuming that the climate gain is $g = 3$ and $B(T_0) = 1.9 \mathrm{W} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{-2} \cdot ({}^\circ \mathrm{C})^{-1}$, what is the expected increase in temperature? 

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution 


So we know that $(1 - a)\delta = 3.7 W/m^2$. So according to the equation, we have the fact that
$$
\delta T_1 = 3.7 \frac{3}{1.9} \approx 5.8^\circ C.
$$
So this is the expected increase in temperature. <span style="color:red;">Note that if a climate gain factor of $g = 1$ is used then this gives an expected increase of 1.9 degrees instead.</span>.  The range of current model predictions, in fact, is about 1.5 to 4.5 degrees so this is not bad.
