## Q1 The bump lemma {.unnumbered}

Prove the following one-dimensional lemma, which was used in the derivation of the heat equation. 

If $\int_a^b g(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0$ for all $a$ and $b \in [0, 1]$, then $g(x) \equiv 0$ for all $x\in [0, 1]$. 

*Hint:* think of a proof by contradiction.

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

Assume by contradiction that $f(x) \neq 0$ between two arbitrary points, say $x_0$ and $x_1$, both in the interval $[a, b]$. Then $\int_{x_0}^{x_1} f(x) \mathrm{d}x \neq 0$. This assumes some degree of smoothness and integrability (as long as $f$ is not too pathological). 
:::

## Q2. A source in the heat equation {.unnumbered}

Consider the same heat experiment discussed in @sec-intro-PDEs but now consider a bar that has an internal source or sink generating or removing heat, such as the case of a boiler with an internal heating element. By adapting a similar derivation to the one presented, explain why the modified conservation of heat equation is 
$$
\frac{\mathrm{\partial}}{\mathrm{\partial}t} \int_a^b \rho c T \, \mathrm{d}x = q(x = a, t) - q(x = b, t) + \int_a^b R(x, t) \, \mathrm{d}x.
$$

In addition:

a. By studying the dimensions of the other terms in the above equation, find what the dimensions of $R$ are. What does $R > 0$ mean and $R < 0$? 

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

On the left, density has units kg/m^3, specific heat J/(kg K), and temperature K. But then dx has units of m. And d/dt has units of 1/s. So altogether, we have the following SI units on the left: 
$$
\frac{J}{m^2 \cdot s}
$$ 

So its energy per unit area per unit time. The reason why it's per unit area is because you have not integrated over the sides of the cylinder/bar. 

So therefore this needs to match the units on the right, which are [R] [dx]. So you conclude that 
$$
[R] = \frac{J}{m^3 \cdot s}
$$ 
i.e. energy per unit time per unit volume. This is energy density.

R > 0 means heat is added into the system (source). R < 0 means heat is removed from the system (sink).

b. Hence derive the partial differential equation that governs the temperature $T$.

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

The derivation follows exactly as in the notes, except you have an additional term on the RHS. Use Fourier's law to convert $q = -k \partial T/\partial x$. Write everything under the integral and this yields: 
$$
\rho c \frac{\mathrm{\partial}T}{\mathrm{\partial}t} = k \frac{\mathrm{\partial}^2 T}{\mathrm{\partial}x^2} + R.
$$ 
:::


c. By introducing the appropriate scalings on each of the variables, $x$, $t$, and $T$, non-dimensionalise the PDE and discuss the non-dimensional parameters (there will be two).

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

Same derivation as in the notes. Let 
$$
x = L x', T = [T]T' \quad \text{and} \quad t = [t]t'.
$$ 
This time you will remember to scale out the typical source strength, so 
$$
R = [R]R'.
$$ 

This leads to 
$$
\frac{\mathrm{\partial}T'}{\mathrm{\partial}t'}
= \left(\frac{k[t]}{L^2 \rho c}\right) \frac{\mathrm{\partial}^2 T'}{\mathrm{\partial}x'^2} + \left(\frac{[R][t]}{\rho c [T]}\right)R'.
$$ 
So this gives the two sets of non-dimensional numbers

\begin{align}
\Pi_1 &= \frac{k[t]}{L^2 \rho c} \\
\Pi_2 &= \frac{[R][t]}{\rho c [T]}.
\end{align}

If you want, you can write it in the alternative form by taking the time scaling to be $[t] = L/U$, where $U$ is some unspecified velocity scale.

For the interpretation, you can simply take $\Pi_1$ to be a measure of diffusive effects (heat spreading out) and $\Pi_2$ to be a measure of source strength. Note that this problem can be simplified even further by choosing the time scale so as to set $\Pi_1 = 1$. If you do this, you will be left with a single non-dimensional parameter that balances diffusion with the strength of the source.

## Q3. The unique timescale in the heat equation {.unnumbered}

During our investigation of the heat equation, we found that it was possible to scale time so as to scale out the only non-dimensional parameter that appears in the PDE. As explained in lectures, the disappearance of all non-dimensional parameters is due to the fact that only a single sensible timescale exists.  

By adjusting the boundary conditions, we may create a new problem involving heat flow where a unique 'special' timescale can no longer be chosen.

 Consider a system where one side of the rod is heated in some periodic fashion, e.g. set the initial and boundary conditions to be 
 \begin{align}
 T(x, 0) &= T_0 \\
 T(0, t) &= T_a \cos (\omega t), \\
 T(L, t) &= T_b.
 \end{align}
 

 a. What must the units of $\omega$ be?


:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

Note  $\omega t$ must be unitless. Therefore $[\omega] = 1/s$.
:::
 

 b. Non-dimensionalise as usual and, without selecting the timescale, $[t]$, identify the key non-dimensional parameters that remain. Write a brief sentence to describe their physical interpretation. 

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

This is exactly the same as in the above heat question. You will still obtain

$$
\frac{\mathrm{\partial}T'}{\mathrm{\partial}t'}
= \Pi_1 \frac{\mathrm{\partial}^2 T'}{\mathrm{\partial}x'^2}
$$ 
where the non-dimensional parameters is the Peclet number introduced in lectures:
$$
\Pi_1 = \left(\frac{k[t]}{L^2 \rho c}\right).
$$ 

The main difference is that now, your boundary conditions are
$$
T'(0, t') = \Pi_3 \cos (\Pi_2 t') \quad \text{and} \quad 
T'(1, t') = \Pi_4
$$ 
where 
$$
\Pi_2 = \omega [t], \qquad \Pi_3 = \frac{T_a}{T_0}, \qquad Pi_4 = T_b/T_0.
$$ 

The scaling on the temperature was taken to be such that the final initial condition is set to unity: 
$$
T'(x', 0) = 1.
$$
:::

 c. There are two sensible choices for setting the timescale, $[t]$. Identify the two choices and present the reduced set of equations in each case. 

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

So there are now two ways of choosing the time scale. Either choose it to set $\Pi_1 = 1$ or choose it to set $\Pi_2 = 1$. In the former choice, you are choosing to set time according to the diffusive rate. In the latter, you are setting time according to how the boundary is heated.
:::
 
## Q4. Timescale in the surface energy {.unnumbered}

Take the basic zero-dimensional energy model studied in (@eq-heateq-earth) for the temperature of the troposphere:
$$
c \frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{1}{4} Q(1 - a) - \sigma \gamma T^4.
$$

a. Non-dimensionalise the model by choosing $T = [T]T'$, $t = [t]t'$, and $Q = [Q]Q'$. Show that it is possible to select the scalings on the temperature and time so as to completely remove all constants from the problem when $Q$ is assumed to be constant. 

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

The question's suggestion of setting $Q = [Q]Q'$ was excessive since $Q$ is just a constant in this case. So proceeding as usual:

Set in the scalings. This time it is easier to balance the right had-side first.
$$
\frac{c[T]}{[t']}\frac{\mathrm{\partial}T'}{\mathrm{\partial}t'} = \left(\frac{Q(1-a)}{4}\right) - \left(\sigma \gamma [T]^4\right) T'^4.
$$ 
So select the temperature scaling so that both coefficients on the RHS are equal.
$$
[T] = \left(\frac{Q(1-a)}{4\sigma \gamma}\right)^{1/4}.
$$ 
Now choose the time scaling also to match the LHS coefficient to the RHS coefficient.
$$
c \frac{[T]}{[t]} = \sigma \gamma [T]^4 \Longrightarrow
[t] = \frac{c}{\sigma \gamma [T]^4}
$$ 
Once you have done this, the equation transforms to the one given in part b.
:::


b. Thus, show that the analysis of the above equation is equivalent to studying
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} = 1 - T^4,
$$
where we have dropped the primes and assumed that the albedo is such that $1 - a \neq 0$.

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

Done above.
:::


c. From your choice of $[t]$, estimate the typical dimensional value using $d \approx 10 \mathrm{km}$, $\rho \approx 1 \mathrm{kg} \,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $c_p \approx 10^3 \mathrm{J} \,\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. \
\
Use a pocket calculator to verify your calculations and conclude that this time-scale is on the order of a month. What is the relevance of this approximation as it concerns the steady-state solution?

:::{.callout-important collapse=true}
## Solution

Below (@eq-heateq-earth), we defined $C = \rho c_p d$. So the scaling on time is (put in the scaling for [T]):
$$
[t] = \left(\frac{4}{(1-a)}\right)^{3/4} \left(\frac{C}{(\sigma \gamma)^{1/4} Q^{3/4}}\right).
$$ 

So we know that $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}$ J/(m^2 s K^4), $Q = 1.38 \times 10^3$ J/(m^2 s). We can also calculate 
$$
C = \rho c_p d = 10^7 J/(K \cdot m^2).
$$ 

We can use $\gamma = 1$ for an estimate. The right-most factor is 
$$
\frac{10^7}{(5.67 \times 10^{-8})^{1/4} (1.378 \times 10^3)^{3/4}} s = 2.88 \times 10^6 s
$$ 

If we use a = 0.3 then this gives a total of 
$$
[t] = 3.7 \times 2.88 \times 10^6 s.
$$ 
To convert to days, note 1 day = 24 hours = 24*60 minutes = 24*60*60 seconds. This is then 
$$ 
[t] = \frac{1.65 \times 10^7}{8.64 \times 10^4} \text{days} = 0.19 \times 10^3 \text{days} = 190 \text{days}.
$$ 
So on the order of 6 months. Any answer you get that's roughly on the order of months sounds about right. This is the rough approximation of how long time-scale effects take to appear.
