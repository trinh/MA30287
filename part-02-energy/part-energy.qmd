# Energy usage and energy sources

The first part of this course is centred upon a seminal book by Cambridge physicist David MacKay [@mackay_book] that was written a number of years ago.

Unlike many other books and discussions on the topic of energy, this one is written with the emphasis placed on developing simple back-of-the-envelope estimates of usage. This is a great philosophy, and one that does well to cut straight to the heart of more long-winded discussions.
